After trying to get pregnant for over a year, the couple began investigating international vs. national adoptions and decided to explore both options.\nMike comes from a very special adoption background in that his parents took in adopted his brother so Mike grew up, sharing meals, playtime and love in their home.\nAfter briefly exploring an international adoption and realizing the wait could be nearly four years for a healthy newborn, the Florida couple shifted gears and began filling out paperwork for a domestic adoption.\nThey were interested in newborns. “We decided to try the domestic route, so my home study agency recommended a local agency to initiate a domestic newborn adoption with a birth mother,” says Mike today. “We were open to sibling groups too.”\n“I come from a family of foster children and my parents took in dozens of  kids over the course of our childhood, and we received many priceless and amazing experiences” says Mike. “We hoped we’d get matched pretty quickly.”\nThey flew through their paperwork, parenting training classes and home study in six months. Mike also has a secret weapon in his adoption arsenal: He has a background in technology and created adoption software that pairs newborns or foster children and awaiting parents. While ParentFinder.com didn’t directly help Mike, he was a fountain of adoption knowledge and by now had adopted not once but twice..\n“We were quickly matched to birth mother in her final month of pregnancy. We spoke for hours, at least five times, and the birth mother seemed ready and eager to be through with it.  We drove north to Virginia in October,  when the baby was due, and bought the mom groceries and clothes, paid some bills for her, and she even asked Mike’s wife Mary to be present with her in the delivery room so that she could cut m', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'Our story', 944, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1314201957, 0),

From the moment he started crawling he has been on the move. He climbs everything (or at least, he tries to). He makes himself at home no matter where he is. Tyler is friendly and outgoing and charms every old lady he meets at the grocery store. He loves to dance, clap, hang upside down, and push his car. He rarely turns down food and always seems to know when we sneak him a vegetable. The curiosity in his eyes and his insatiable energy is keeping us young!  \n\nThe love we feel for Tyler has strengthened our marriage and made us a more complete family.  At times we can''t wait to see how his little personality develops and what interests he will have.  We look forward to watching him grow and see who he becomes in the future.\n\nTyler''s Adoption \n\nIn the spring of 2010 we got the phone call that would change our lives forever; a birthmother from Florida named Brandi had created an adoption plan for her son and chose us to parent him. It was one of the happiest days of our lives! At her request we planned on being at the hospital for his birth. We were so honored she wanted us there to help support her. About a month, and several phone calls later, we headed to sunny Florida to meet Brandi face to face and see our new little man. Early the next morning, before the sun was up, Tyler was born.  We are so happy that we can tell him we were all there together to welcome him into the world with love.\n\nMay of 2010 was the first time we spoke to Tyler''s birth mother, Brandi. We were so grateful to have the chance to learn more about her and her family. Every piece of information we were given has been written down and is waiting for Tyler when he is ready. It is important for our son to know that she chose adoption out of the love she had for him. Since the day he was born, we have talked to him about his birth family.

My Mother was adopted, so I have some understanding of how it makes no difference if your child is your biological offspring or not, as my Grand Parents loved her as their own, perhaps even more so as my mother was a gift fulfilled to them.  I have many hobbies and interests, many of which can be shared with a growing child and for as much of me that is the responsible adult, I am but a kid at heart.  I attended College and graduated with an associate’s degree in Illustration and work as a professional tattoo artist and business owner with two well established and successful business locations.  I also do freelance illustration work on the side.  My career has afforded us to be able to travel all over the world, working as a guest artist in many countries.  We love to travel and adventure, and have been all over America, Europe, Costa Rica, Iceland, Japan, and Bali. I love taking in and learning about the many aspects of different cultures.  I would not label myself a religious person, but I can say with confidence and pride that I am a very Spiritual person, and feel deeply that we are all intrinsically connected.   I am all about Karma and this belief drives me to be the best person I can be.   I know that Jennifer will be an amazing mother to your child.

It takes a very brave mother with strength and a lot of guts and we commend you. We can only imagine what feelings you may be going through and the circumstances that have led you to the truly compassionate decision to bring this child to term and seek out a loving family who for whatever reason has chosen the path of adoption. Our own reason for choosing the gift and miracle of adoption comes from years of trying to conceive, but to no avail. Over the past few years, Jennifer had two failed pregnancies which led to the total loss of being able to conceive naturally. IVF was deemed too risky, and we came to the realization that we would much rather provide for an adoptive child and know without a doubt that we would love, cherish, guide, and nurture your child no differently than if the child was our own. We can provide so much opportunity and adventure, and believe in allowing a child the freedom to pursue his or her own interests while introducing lots of new activities and experiences. We have so much joy and love for each other and the world, and we hope to share that love unconditionally if you choose us as adoptive parents.

Walter is a tough, but sweet Jack Russell Terrier, and Goldie is a gentle Sheltie mix. They''re the nicest dogs either of us have ever had and we''ve had them both about four years.\nWe are lucky that our jobs (we''re both teachers) will allow both of us to take a lot of time-off, including a year-long sabbatical, for child-care. We have both been teaching for more than ten years, so we know the hard parts and the great parts that come with taking care of children. We haven''t had a child as a part of our own family, but we know it will add an immeasurable depth and joy to our lives.\nWe have also both been lucky to have been able to travel around a lot. We''ve been to India, where we go to visit\nRema''s family. We''ve also been to Europe and we''ve travel around many different states in the US. We both enjoy new places, cultures, ways of living, foods, music and traditions and we know that being able to share our appreciation of the world with a child will be as good for us as for the child. Both of us also love music, reading, movies (not always the same music, books or movies), cooking, swimming, camping, walking and bike riding.\nWe''ve been married ten years. We met each other eleven years ago at work. We live in a three-bedroom house in a\nsafe, friendly neighborhood with good schools. Our house is across the street from bike trails and hiking trails and near playgrounds and the recreation center.\nRema''s mother visits us every two or three years, from India, and we see John''s parents, his sisters, niece and nephew regularly. OUR parents are very excited about welcoming a grandchild into the family and our friends and neighbors are excited about our decision to adopt.\nWe have the desire, patience and the love needed to give a child a great start in life and a sense of the wonder of the world. We will provide a stable, safe and stimulating home and a place your baby can imagine, choose and build for his or her future.\nWe would love to meet you, so you can get to know us and feel absolutely comfortable about choosing us.', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'Birth Parent Letter', 1160, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1349578899, 0),

She went out of her way for me, it just goes to show what a caring person she is. That was about 6 years ago. More recently I met Brad at another cousins wedding. We sat at the same table as them, and we got along so well and had such a great time with them. I think, if I remember correctly, this is when they were just starting their adoption journey. They are incredibly loving and caring people, they have a great relationship with each other, which is amazing with all they have been through trying to have a baby; they want nothing more than to be parents and share their love of life with a son/daughter. I hope that you are truly considering them to raise your baby, I don''t think you could possibly choose better parents for her. On top of that, they have a great family, her parents are moving to be closer to her since they are retired, which I think is amazing!!!! Thank you for asking this and letting me share my thoughts!!! Good luck with your decision, I know it cannot be easy, but rest assured you are on the right track with this couple!!!\nAmanda writes:\n"I''ve known and been friends with Deidre since grade school through high school.

He is a great guy and those two make a perfect couple! Our daughter is almost 2 and she was drawn to Brad right away and didn''t leave his side all night as he played with her. Deidre brought her stickers and coloring books which she loved. She remembers that day and every once in a while will want to talk about it and say "Dee Dee! (whom she called both Brad and Deidre that night). That night we also talked about their long road to wanting to become parents and I can tell how much they want to parent. They would give your little baby so much love and she would be lucky to have them as parents."\nChristine writes:\n	My family lives just a door down from Brad and Deidre. I feel very fortunate to have the best neighbors in the world. We met them not long after they moved in, many years ago. They are both honest, sweet, fun loving people who truly love each other. My family and theirs has something in common. We tried for years to conceive and were unable. We now have 11 year old twins that we adopted at birth. I have spoken over the course of Brad and Deidre’s journey through adoption as a neighbor and friend. It has been a long road for them and I know that adopting is the one thing they want more than anything in their lives. When you have to wait and be patient for God to bring you the child you know is meant to be your family it is very hard. Believe me I know firsthand. It would be a true blessing for the them and I know they would do anything in their power to give your precious baby all the love, nurturing and support she will need to grow up and be a great person, just like they are. When you wait and pray for something so hard when you finally get it you never take it for granted.\nSarah writes:\n	I''ve known Deidre since we were in Junior High. She and Brad are a wonderful couple. They''re loving and stable with a close knit family. They''re honest, reliable and stable people with hearts of gold. They''ve wanted a child for so long. A child would be so lucky to grow up in their loving home surrounded by aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins and friends. Brad and Deidre are warm, welcoming, honest, stable, hardworking people who will give their child an amazing upbringing.

This is so true, when on a blessed day in December 2002; we received a call about a baby boy. We were going to be parents and our life changed for the better. Having the opportunity to parent our son has been an incredible, sensational experience. While this was a joyous time for us, we thought about our son’s birth parents and continue to think about them everyday, everyday. What an honor they placed upon us…allowing us to parent their baby.  We are so thankful for their decision. When discussing his adoption story with him, we always convey to our son how much his birth parents loved and sacrificed for him. They have shown an incredibly selfless act of love to our son and us. \n \nGrowing as a family through adoption has been an incredible and joyous experience for us. We have met many wonderful people through Logan’s adoption process, from the hardworking social workers to his foster parents.  We had so much trouble choosing his god parents that he ended up with three sets.  Everyone is excited and supportive of welcoming another child into our family through adoption. \n\nWe know that your journey has just begun and moving forward will also not be easy. With your decision you are giving your baby a chance at a better life and at the same time blessing a couple with the gift of parenthood.

Justin grew up in northern VA and lived in the same house until he was 19 yrs old.  His family moved to central Florida at that time and they all still live there today.\n\nKim was born in Philadelphia, PA in 1980 as the youngest of 3 girls.  She lived in Delaware until she was 12 yrs old, when her family moved to south Florida where they all still live today.\n\nWe met in March of 1998 in Deerfield Beach, Florida.  Both of us were guests at a wedding.  Justin was a sophomore in college and Kim was a senior in high school.  Justin can still remember seeing Kim for the first time.  She was wearing a pretty flowered dress and holding a basket of wedding programs.  Kim remembers thinking Justin was so cute!  We began dating from that day and dated for almost 2 years.  We then both finished college and Justin was commissioned into the Air Force.  He traveled extensively throughout the country and to the middle east.\n\nIn 2005, we crossed paths again and knew we were meant to be together.  We got married in July of 2006 and God richly blessed our wedding day with the outpouring of love from our family and friends.  \n\nSince then we have lived in several states due to Air Force assignments and moving for graduate schools.  Justin also separated from the Air Force in 2009 to become a full-time law student.  He recently graduated law school and will soon begin work in legal council at the federal government level.  \n\nWe are best friends, partners, and teammates.  We are so grateful to the Lord for blessing us with each other and placing us in beautiful families.  We are so excited to become parents as we have wanted to add children to our family since we married.

I will always be grateful to you, and you will always hold a special place in my heart.  Whatever led you to choose adoption, it is important that you know deep in your heart that your baby will be loved very much and all his/her needs will be met.  Your baby will be our baby in every way.  I will always think of you and let our child know that you are very special people.\n \n\nWhen the time comes, I will tell our baby about you and the adoption process.  If there are specific thoughts and feelings that you’d like me to share about you with our child, or if you’d like to know specific things about me, please let me know by sharing those thoughts through letters or telephone calls to the case worker.\nBecause I have to work, I have already arranged for a very reliable friend to provide day care.  She has her own in-home daycare and is wonderful with children.  She is also a very special person in many ways.  She was adopted and because of her experience is able to relate to adopted children in a unique way. \n \nIf the things I’ve shared about myself make you feel that I would be the best person to become your child’s mother, please know that I will work every day to prove worthy of your trust. \n \n\nPatiently waiting parent,\n', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'Birthmother Letter', 1581, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1326484363, 0),

As I was reading I remember having such a comforting and happy feeling. Heather and Jason and their four boys looked so happy and I could tell that they were a family that had complete trust in God. This was it! This was the family that God had chosen for my baby girl...[Before giving birth] Heather came all the way from Washington to spend the week with me. We walked and talked for hours. We were instant friends. Heather and I became very close in that week and we shared many stories. We made new memories as well...Signing my rights over as [Faith''s] mother was the most difficult thing I''ve ever done...Heather made sure to let me know that I would always be a part of [her] life and that Faith will always know that I chose adoption for her because I loved her so much and wanted her to have everything she could ever dream of...  Heather and Jason have kept every promise to me they have ever made... They have given me so much love and I know without a doubt that they truly care for my well being and they consider me apart of the family...The first time I was able to see Faith...since I left the hospital, I was reassured that I had made the right choice...Everything had fallen into place. Heather and Jason were Mom and Dad and I was Aunt Victoria. Faith was so comfortable with her family and such a bright happy little girl. She has a wonderful life. This family is so amazing and there aren''t enough words or paper in this world to describe the love and adoration I have for them. In my eyes they are the perfect family. Heather and Jason are always there when I need them with love, advice, and support.

Words can''t express the love that we have for her. She is a very special part of our family. Our relationship started out very slow and cautious on both parts but after a while we have figured out the kind of relationship that we want for each other. Sometimes we go for long periods of time without talking, other times we spend time texting and every once in a while we enjoy taking on the phone. We have enjoyed several visits since Faith was born. Those visits are filled with both laughter and tears which always brings us closer together. We have a great appreciation for the gift she has given us and for the strength she has. We continue to encourage her to set goals for herself and one at a time achieve those goals. We are so excited for the life that she is living and the love that we share for each other.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.parentfinder.com/media/users/outnumbered/IMG_5171.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="238" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>            My name is Victoria and I am twenty-two years old. I was in the same difficult position that you are in right now...As I opened [their profile], I took the deepest breath I could possibly take and began to read about the family. As I was reading I remember having such a comforting and happy feeling. Heather and Jason and their four boys looked so happy and I could tell that they were a family that had complete trust in God. This was it! This was the family that God had chosen for my baby girl...[Before giving birth] Heather came all the way from Washington to spend the week with me. We walked and talked for hours. We were instant friends. Heather and I became very close in that week and we shared many stories. We made new memories as well...Signing my rights over as [Faith''s] mother was the most difficult thing I''ve ever done...Heather made sure to let me know that I would always be a part of [her] life and that Faith will always know that I chose adoption for her because I loved her so much and wanted her to have everything she could ever dream of...  Heather and Jason have kept every promise to me they have ever made... They have given me so much love and I know without a doubt that they truly care for my well being and they consider me apart of the family...The first time I was able to see Faith...since I left the hospital, I was reassured that I had made the right choice...Everything had fallen into place. Heather and Jason were Mom and Dad and I was Aunt Victoria. Faith was so comfortable with her family and such a bright happy little girl. She has a wonderful life. This family is so amazing and there aren''t enough words or paper in this world to describe the love and adoration I have for them. In my eyes they are the perfect family. Heather and Jason are always there when I need them with love, advice, and support. They have had a huge part in my healing process and they remind me often that Faith will know who I am and why I chose adoption for her. They are both loving, caring, Christian people. They truly care about my feelings and they help me to make it through each day.<br />            Birth Mom, I am writing to tell you that this process is not easy, but each day that passes gets a little easier.

A place that we can relax and just be together. We enjoy having family movie nights where we all snuggle together on our huge couch. We have fire pits in our secluded backyard where we roast marshmallows and sing praise songs. We have a little sitting area in our master bedroom where Heather has her morning coffee and enjoys a good book. This is also where as a couple we hash out the days events after the kids are all tucked into bed. This quiet place is where Alex had his first cup of (decaf) coffee as he and his dad talked man to man about life and it''s ups and downs. This is a special place where it is quiet and anyone can come to have some alone time or one on one time with someone special.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src="http://www.parentfinder.com/media/users/outnumbered/living_room_1.JPG" alt="" width="370" height="208" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Often all four boys will be sprawled across the living room floor with Faith bounding over their bodies while they set up a mini figurine city from one side of the room to the other. Other times they are setting up a family football game in the yard while Jason builds a fire for an evening of marshmallows and singing. Many afternoons they ride their bikes and scooters together with Faith tagging along in her little motorized 4-wheeler and Alex running his remote car between everyone trying not to get hit.

Our friendship was given time to develop as we found a similar joy in being together.On April 4th 2003, after a night at the movies with a group of friends, I surprised Sydni at a Karaoke place by singing a song to her in front of a roomful of mostly strangers.  It was a song that I wrote to the tune of "Time after Time" and I ended it with " Now You Decide." It was then with the microphone in hand I requested Sydni to be my girlfriend.\nOur dating relationship was an exciting time as we had gotten to learn so much more about one another. Our love for one another was growing so strong and so deep,I tried to hide my truest feelings until October 4th, 2003. Six months to the day since we had begun dating. Sydni was in Niagara Falls with a group of her friends and planning to return to PA to have a date with me. She was surprised to receive a box from a messenger with an elegant red dress in it that she had told me she liked a few months earlier. Then as she proceeded back home her friend excused herself to go ask directions. As Sydni walked down the sidewalk, I stepped out of a horse-drawn buggy and gave her both a long hug and a bouquet of flowers. We then went for a carriage ride to a gazebo overlooking Lake Ontario. It was there that I read my princess a poem and asked her to be my wife. We intend to work with all our hearts to be the very best for one another that we can possibly be, all the while giving thanks to God through our Lord Jesus Christ. \n\nHe who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord.

He has nine brothers and sisters so the house was always “active”. BJ’s mom still lives in the house where all the children grew up and where they all return for special events and holidays. BJ remains close to his mother, nine siblings, seven in-laws, and 17 nieces and nephews. Family traditions are very special to us and we look forward to passing them onto our child.

(531, 'We married in 2010, but we met over 25 years ago.  We are truly living an amazing love story.  We met after a football game in junior high.  It''s funny how some moments are permanently etched in your memory.  The chill in the fall air, the excitement and energy from a winning game, the butterflies in your stomach from meeting someone new when you least expect it.  This was one of those moments and from then on we were each other''s best friend. It''s like there was a bigger plan.  After much heartache, we split when the decision was made for Lisa to go off to college and Don joined the Marine Corps.  Before Don left for the Marine Corp he left a letter on Lisa''s windshield.  The letter expressed Don''s desire to be a Marine and his support of Lisa''s success at school.  He promised that one day we would be back together even if it was many years in the future.  The funny thing about the letter is that he wrote on it "you better have this letter 20 years from now at our reunion!"\nTwenty years later, Lisa is a school administrator.  Don''s daughter enrolls in her school.  Lisa helps her get accepted into a specialized program and never tells the daughter that she was her father''s first love.  A mutual friend finds out that Lisa helped Don''s daughter get into the program and Don contacts Lisa to thank her.  Next thing you know Don and Lisa go to their high school reunion together and its 20 years later!  Imagine Don''s surprise when Lisa showed him the letter that was written to her 20 years earlier!  It''s now one of their most cherished possessions.  \nWithout sounding too sappy, there wasn''t a day that went by where we didn''t think of each other.  We have a strong faith in that some things are just meant to be.  We are so thankful that we have been blessed to be together.  It just had to be the right time and the right place.

Our entire dating relationship was more like a fairy tale.  The respect my prince charming has constantly shown to me had borne fruit with a purity in our dating relationship.  If we were to have the privilege of raising a little boy, he would have a great role model, especially in learning how to treat women.

From working with a Children''s Ministry, teaching faith formation to Seventh Graders, spending quality time with our god-children, and playing with our many friend''s kids, Roy has a wonderful way of connecting with and bringing a smile to a child''s face.

(622, 'Hola,\n\nNos llamamos Ramón y Anne.  Nos gustaría comenzar por darles las gracias por su valiente decisión a considerar adopción.  Sabemos que al hacer esta decisión solamente quieren lo mejor para su hijo y respetamos su deseo de encontrar la mejor familia para amar y cuidar a su bebé.  (En esta carta cuando usamos hijo/niño, queremos decir hija/niña también).  Escogimos fotos que capturaron el amor que compartimos como una pareja y como una familia, y apreciamos que tomen el tiempo para leer nuestra carta.  Esperamos la oportunidad de conocerles para decirles más de quienes somos nosotros y cuánto su hijo será amado por nosotros y nuestra familia entera.\n\n\nAnne: Nací en 1965 en Long Island, Nueva York, donde mis padres todavía viven en la casa de mi niñez.  Tengo una hermana que es tres años menor que yo y que tiene tres hijos.  Todos ellos viven en Texas.  Gradué del Colegio de Marymount en 1989 e inmediatamente comencé a enseñar.  En 1990 me mudé a San Francisco, California donde enseñé educación especial y serví como administradora en la misma escuela por 12 años.  Durante este tiempo recibí la maestría en educación especial de la Universidad Estatal de San Francisco.  En 2002 me mudé a Texas y seguí enseñando educación especial para la misma escuela hasta que me mudé a Arizona en 2009.  Hoy en día trabajo como especialista en comportamiento para un distrito escolar local.  Me gusta decorar, cocinar, ver películas graciosas, estar con Ramón, leer y ayudar a otros.  Como especialista en comportamiento puedo ayudar a maestras y a padres a trabajar con niños que tienen dificultades de comportamiento.  Soy miembra de Beta Sigma Phi, una organización de servicio para mujeres y en 2011 me eligieron Reina del baile del Día de San Valentín.\n\n\n\nRamón: Nací en 1973 en Texas.  Soy hijo único y tengo una relación muy íntima con mis padres quienes viven en Texas.  Crecí en un hogar bilingue y hablo español e inglés.  Pasé varios años como gerente de ventas antes de recibir el bachiller en sociología con un énfasis global de la Universidad de Texas A y M en 2001.  Después de la graduación comencé a enseñar educación especial en una escuela para niños con incapacidades emocionales y de comportamiento.  En 2009 dejé la enseñanza y comencé a trabajar como un oficial federal de cumplimiento de la ley y fui asignado a un puesto en el sur de Arizona.  Hoy en día estoy completando una maestría en administración pública en la Universidad de Wayland Baptist.  Pienso graduarme en el otoño de 2012.  Me gusta escuchar y tocar música, levantar pesas, pasar tiempo en el agua (piscina, playa o lago), hacer comida asada, estar con Anne, aprender y trabajar duro para avanzar mi carrera para sustentar a mi familia.\n\n\nNos conocimos en 2003 mientras estábamos enseñando en la misma escuela en Texas y en septiembre de 2006 nos casamos.  Nos gusta pasar  tiempo juntos y hacemos casi todo juntos.  Hacemos un viaje grande cada verano, generalmente a Nueva York o a algún lugar con playa.  Nos gustan los deportes, especialmente el béisbol y el fútbol americano.  Anne es aficionada de los Yankes de Nuevo York y Ramón fue criado para aclamar a de los Cowboys de Dallas.  Aunque apoyamos a equipos diferentes, nos gusta asistir a eventos deportivos en vivo, especialmente NHRA Drag Racing (carreras de autos).  Compartimos los quehaceres de la casa y cocinamos la cena juntos cada noche.  Nos gusta experimentar con recetas nuevas y vivir una vida saludable haciendo ejercicio y comiendo bien.  Somos católicos, apoyamos a nuestra iglesia y asistimos a la misa cada semana.\n\nEstamos muy emocionados y listos para ser padres.  Hemos orado sobre esto y creemos que es el plan de Diós para nosotros que acojamos a un niño a nuestra familia por medio de adopción.  Queremos compartir con nuestro niño todas las experiencias maravillosas y tradiciones con que hemos sido benditos y sobre todo, amar a nuestro niño en la manera en que nuestros padres nos aman; porque ese es el mejor regalo que podemos dar a él o a ella.  Es nuestro deseo de criar a nuestro niño para que sea educado y que se convierta en una persona responsable y respetuosa.  Cuando nuestro niño llegue, Anne se quedará en casa por  tres meses y después tal vez regresará al trabajo por dos días a la semana cuando Ramón no esté trabajando.\n\nGracias otra vez por tomar el tiempo para saber más sobre nosotros.  Si nos escoje, seremos benditos, y su hijo será amado completamente y sin condición, no solamente por nosotros, sino por cada persona en nuestra familia.\n\nSinceramente,\nRamón y Anne\n', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'Nuestra Informacion en espanol', 2534, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1332729926, 0),

stop her feet ever since (nor have we tried).  Brianna is not only a featured member in her dance school''s Classical Ballet, Tap, Jazz, Modern and Hip Hop Companies, but she also works as an

favorite name "crabby-dabby-doo" for one of the hermit crabs.  Alex is becoming a great reader and has gotten so confident in his abilities, that not only does he enjoy reading to himself now, but he

(656, '     I have always known I wanted children.  It’s always been my choice, but never an option.\n     If I went to sleep this evening and woke up with a child, through adoption…I would only be able to describe the child in two words.  Unconditionally loved! \n     At the age of 9, I found out that I would be unable to have children.  This was a heavy burden to bear at such a young age, but as I’ve gotten older, the heaviness has weighed on my heart.  Through a series of routine medical tests, my sister (my only sibling) and I found out that we had developed fibrous tumors in place of where our ovaries should have been.  Both of us required surgeries to remove the tumors.  Mine were a little more dense, and a full hysterectomy was needed in order to be healthy and thrive.  My sister was able to maintain her uterus, making invitro fertilization an option for her, later in life.  After some complications, my sister was able to carry a full term baby via IVF.  Due to the toll the pregnancy took on her body, she too required a full hysterectomy, soon after the birth of my first nephew.  Since, she and her husband have adopted two children.  My sister’s journey through adoption has shown me that no matter how a child comes into my life, they have grown in my heart for my lifetime.       \n     Today, I am healthy and am anxious for motherhood.  I want to share my hobbies of baking, cake decorating, cooking, reading and my most recent…golfing, with a child.\n     During our courtship, I had to face the difficult task of telling my husband that I was unable to have children.  So often, we hear of people who have been told that they cannot have children, but then, receive the surprise of their life when they do.  For me, this would never be the case.  My infertility is certain.  And, I thought could be a “deal breaker” when dating.  Luckily for me, my husband didn’t hesitate.  He accepted my infertility and the fact that adoption would one day be part of our life as a couple.  \n     As an elementary school teacher, I have always had a fondness for children.  I wouldn’t have chosen such a career path, if that were not the case.  While I will not carry a child in my body, I know that being a mother is what I am meant to be.  Not only have I prayed for the child that will change my life, I also have prayed for the courageous individual or couple that would make that possible.  I already respect the birthparent(s) of my child, and will always do right by them.  \n     I grew up in a small town in a home that was full of love and great memories.  My mother and father met in Jr. High School and have been together ever since.  They raised my sister and me in an environment that allowed us to succeed in school, be surrounded by a very large extended family and to enjoy as many extracurricular activities as we could handle.  Between dance classes, baton classes, music lessons, cheerleading practices, softball games, choir concerts, school musicals, track meets  and a number of other activities, I am amazed at the love, support and dedication my parents have shown. It has never wavered.  Today, my parents are not only my life mentors, they are my friends\n     Every Sunday, our family would attend church and often follow services with brunch.  My parents always felt that my sister and I needed to learn how to dine out and show manners outside the home.  For my sister and me, going to college was never a choice.  It was required by our parents.  And they made sure that we succeeded.  The drive and determination my parents had for me is what has allowed me to build a life of fulfillment and success.  I have completed college, obtained a Masters Degree and have a secure job.  I am married to the love of my life.  I am surrounded by countless friends and family members.  But…the one thing that is missing…that would make my life complete…is being a mother.  I want to give a child the same experiences my parents gave to me.  \n     I am a step-mother to an amazing and beautiful teenage girl.  When I married my husband, I felt as if she was a “bonus” to our relationship.  She and I share a special bond and I love her as if she were my own.  However, she did not come into my life until she was nearly a teenager.  I did not get to experience the things I want to experience with a child of my own.  First steps.  First words.  First haircut.  First day of school.  Classroom parties.  Birthday parties.  Learning to swim and ride a bike.  Nonetheless, she is an integral part of my life.\n     Today, my sister has 3 children that are eagerly awaiting a new cousin to play with and love.  My sister, who just completed her PhD program is happily married and is anxiously awaiting to be “the aunt I have been to her children.”  She is three years older than me and has always served as a role model to me.  We grew up extremely close, yet our interests were not very similar.  She enjoyed all things “academic.”  \n    I, on the other hand, always achieved good grades, but also enjoyed playing.  I was always using my imagination to create new games and crafts.  Nonetheless, we both grew up happy and can truly not think of a time in life where sadness set in.  \n     Our parents were, and still are, our biggest supporters.  My parents, who live less than 10 miles from us, think it’s their “duty” to give as much love to each of their grandchildren as possible.  My father, who is a man of great integrity and ethics, is newly retired from his job in “Corporate America.” My mother, who is witty and extremely generous, works as a secretary for a small, local business.  She hopes to retire soon, as well.  Their motivation?  “We want to spend as much time with our grandchildren as possible!”  I feel so lucky to have the relationship I have with them.  Christmases and other special holidays and events just seem more “magical’ because having my parents around just makes it that way.  I am lucky to be so close to my husband’s parents, as well.  They treat me as if I were born to them.   Any child that joins our family will have a heart that is filled with love. We are blessed with lots of family.\n      No words could ever express what I truly feel for the birthparent or parents of my possible child.  Because I have known for most of my life that adoption was my only means of having a child, I have always kept the parents of my possible child in my thoughts and prayers.  The respect and gratitude I have towards them will never be enough.  It may seem strange to pray for individuals that I do not know, but in a way, because I know the love I have to offer a child, I am able to know the respect and gratitude I have towards those that gave him/her life.  Life is precious, in all forms, and I will never take that for granted.  \n     Circumstances determine the life we all can have…including the child I am eagerly awaiting for.  The same goes for birthparents. I believe that circumstances will lead them to the choice of adoption.  And sometimes, circumstances are not to be questioned.  \n\nJust respected.  \n\nAppreciated.  \n\nHonored.  \n     \n     Our intentions are to always honor the birthparents of our child.  Our child will know of our deep desire to have him/her in our lives. \n      Our child will also know the deep desire his/her birthparents had, to make sure he/she would have the life full of love, support and family that only Michael and I can give.  For that, I will be eternally grateful. \n      I know that Michael and I will be attentive parents. \nI went to school in the same school system from Kindergarten through twelfth grade.  At 3 years old, I became friends with 3 girls, in my church Sunday school class.  To this day, those three girls are my best friends.  We have been there to support each other through the ups and downs in life.  The three of them have young children and I eagerly await introducing our child to them and their families.  \n     In high school, I was actively involved in activities and held a 3.8 GPA.  I was president of the student council and captain of the varsity cheerleading squad.  The experiences I had in high school were ones of great fun and memories.  I look back on those years with a smile.  \n     I went to a small, liberal arts college and obtained a degree in Elementary Education.  There, I made some significant friendships that sustain me through good and bad times to this day.  At least 4-5 times a year, my college friends and their families get together to play games, have cookouts and just laugh.  Our families have become close and we all enjoy these times together.  They, too, are excited about our adoption journey.  \n     Upon my college graduation, I obtained my teaching position.  I, first, taught English as a Second Language (ESL) in grades K-12.  Through the experience, I was able to appreciate various cultures, other than my own. It was an amazing experience.  I have worked in one of the state’s leading schools, and have established a wonderful career for myself.  Having taught Kindergarten, First, Second and Third grade, I am fully aware of the importance of laying a solid educational foundation for a child.  Michael and I intend to be actively involved in our child’s academic future and all that encompasses it.  \n     Soon after I began teaching, I obtained my Masters Degree in School Administration and went on to obtain a certification in School Principal.  My career has provided me with numerous moments of self-satisfaction and achievement…even being chosen as “Teacher of the Year,” in our regional area.  I have formed friendships and lifelong bonds with many coworkers, students and parents over the years.  In a tough economy, I feel lucky to have a job that I truly love, has a schedule that is flexible for a parent and is secure. \n     Aside from meeting my husband, marrying him and gaining a step-daughter, I have been blessed to have significant moments in my life that touch me each day.  At the age of 15, I was chosen to be the Godmother to my beautiful baby cousin.  At the time, my aunt and uncle saw, in me, the love I had for children and the longing I had always had…even at a young age…to be a mother.  Aware of my infertility, they chose me to baptize their daughter, my cousin.  That moment is one that I will never forget.  My godchild and I have a true closeness that has been built out of love and trust.   Now, a successful college graduate with her first "real" job, I have never missed a dance recital, school concert or formal dance that she took part in.  I was there to cheer her on…and shed some bittersweet tears…as she graduated from high school and college.  \n     As I get older, I have found that I am a person that genuinely appreciates tradition.  My godchild’s birthday is Christmas Eve…and every year, since she was one years old, she and I have gone out to lunch on her special day.  Each year, along with her birthday gifts, I present her with a new “Night Before Christmas” book.  This little tradition may seem insignificant, but it means a lot to both of us.  She has always told me that she can’t wait to read every one of those books to my child, someday.  Perhaps, a new tradition?  \n     Equally as significant was the birth of my first nephew.  Knowing the challenges my sister faced, due to her invitro procedure, the birth of my first nephew seemed as if it were a miracle, of sorts.  I will never forget that fall day.  Just weeks after September 11, 2001, I hopped on a plane and flew to be with my sister in another state, as she gave birth to my nephew.  The first night they spent in the hospital, I stayed, too!  I held him the entire night on the day of his birth.  I literally never went to sleep.  I took in every move he made.  Every sound he uttered.  I truly held a miracle that night.  I know that the feeling will be even more joyous the day I get to hold the child that I will get to raise.  I am known as the “favorite aunt” to my nephews and niece.  In fact, as I write this, I just got a phone call from my oldest nephew…he just got his first cell phone!  His first call…me!  I feel so grateful for moments like these.                                                                                   I have served as a bridesmaid in 21…yes, 21 weddings!  To be asked that many times is an honor.  Each of those times has been special to me and for different reasons.  When people get married, they want their day to be “perfect.”  To be asked by that many couples to have such a special role in their “perfect” day is humbling.  In turn, Michael and I had 32 attendants in our own wedding.  While our wedding day was filled with many people, from different stages of our lives, the most blessed part is the marriage we share today. I don’t take this for granted.  In fact, our “tradition” is making sure that we have a “date,” each month, on the date we were married.  We are anxious to involve a child in this special monthly tradition. \n     Before I was married, I bought my first home.  It was a learning process and one I took great pride in.  It was scary to sign so many papers and know that I was a homeowner, but it was equally as exciting.  Beyond the fun of decorating and having a place to call my own, I felt a sense of achievement for getting myself to such a place in life. To have worked hard in school, obtain a secure job and to commit to buying a home gave me a sense of pride.  Today, Michael and I share this same home.  Memories of our first days as a couple, family gatherings and fun times have been formed in this home.  We look forward to this home being the home we bring our child home to.  It truly is the memories that make a house a “home.” \n      Above all of these significant moments in life…the one I feel that is most significant is the moments we are living right now.  As a child, I played with baby dolls.  As a teenager, I was the babysitter of “choice” for many people in our community.  In college, I worked to help children in need by volunteering for the Children’s Miracle Network.  A few years into my teaching career, I became a teacher of “choice,” and each year my classroom is filled with children whose parents request me.  \n    Now…in this moment…my husband and I have taken the steps towards creating a family, through adoption.  With so much “GOOD” in my life, I know the “GREAT” will be the day we get to bring a child into our home.    That, in itself is significant beyond words.\n     Our dreams for our child are simple, yet complex.  With two parents, a step-sister, 4 grandparents, an aunt, uncle, 3 cousins, a large extended family and numerous friends…all waiting to welcome a child to our world, we know he/she will be loved and supported beyond belief.  We want our child to be healthy, happy and get a good education.  Even more, we wish for our child to grow up with a rich faith, a strong spirit and an understanding of how they came into this world.  Truth, honesty and good morals will sustain our child through life and guide him/her to learn from the mistakes he/she may make in life and also to soar to great heights from the successes he/she will achieve.  We want our child to grow to work hard and play hard.  To take pride in his/her work and all that encompasses it.   We want our child to appreciate the small and large things people do for him/her and just as important, appreciate the small/large things he/she does for others. We look forward to seeing life through the eyes of a child.  There is an innocence and a pure joy about viewing the world through a child’s simplicity.  It will surely be refreshing!  We are anxious to expand our family through the gift of adoption.\n     We will work hard to be the family we dream to be and be the family the birthparent or parents dream we will be.  We know we can make this happen and we are anxiously awaiting the day we can begin!\n', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'About Beth...A Mother&#039;s Hope...', 2395, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1349281797, 0),
(657, '     I''ve always known I wanted children.  I wanted to be the parent my parents were to me.  \n     During our courtship, my wife expressed to me her desire to have children and a family.  I, too, wanted the same thing.  She further told me that she was unable to have children, due to a past medical condition, that resulted in certain infertility. This was something I didn’t even need to think about.  Knowing that her sister had three children (two of which were adopted); I knew the love a family could have for children that were not biological.  As adoption being our only choice, I accepted that it would be the means to creating a family together, although a possibly difficult and lengthy process. We both agreed that an infant is what we would want to adopt.           \n     Being the “rock” in our marriage, when dealing with our infertility, makes me more certain than ever that adoption is the right choice for us. \n     Having grown up an only child, I sometimes wished I had siblings.  I grew up having cousins close in age, but never got to experience what it was like to have a sister and/or brother.  This is something I would like for my own child/children, if that is what is meant to be.  \n     I grew up in a happy home with my mother and father.  They had been married about three years before having me.  My parents have a strong marriage that has endured the “normal” ups and downs of life…losing parents, failed attempts at becoming pregnant, and the loss of jobs, due to the economy.  Today, my parents are still happily married, are healthy and are eagerly awaiting a new grandchild!  My mother is a homemaker.  She enjoys baking, music and crafting.  My father has a secure job with the state and also, is the owner of a small business.  He works hard and has always been the provider for our family. I have always admired his dedication to working and maintaining our home.  He is a man of great integrity and has been my most significant role model.   I work with him in our small, family business.   It provides us with a secure paycheck, as well as a somewhat flexible schedule.  In a few years, the plan is for me to take over the family business, with the possibility to expand. \n     Together, my parents have provided me with all of the necessities in life…food, shelter, clothing and an education.  Our family is Catholic and we attended church regularly, as I grew up.  I was extremely active in sports, as a child and teenager.  My parents were always there to support me, provide equipment and guidance and to cheer me on.  As a family, we enjoyed attending sporting events.   My parents were often the ones to transport many of my friends and even serve a “parents” and cheerleaders to those teammates that weren’t as lucky as me.  \n     As an only child, I saw my parents, in a way, be “parents” to so many.  Today, my parents are in good health and live less than 10 minutes from me.  I speak to them daily and we have a very strong and close relationship.  They have embraced my wife and consider her their other child.  They never miss a chance to tell us how much they love both of us. Luckily for me, in marriage, I gained two more loving and devoted parents with my in-laws. \n     I attended parochial school for the first 7 years of my education.  I received good grades and was considered a “well-behaved” student.  My mother was often seen at my school, helping out with the PTA.  Getting good grades and behaving were expectations my parents had for me.  In 8th grade, I transferred to the local public school, where I was equally successful.  I played basketball, football, track and baseball.  In my high school sports career, I lettered each year and to this day, still hold a few school records in track!  The friendships I formed in my early Jr. High years are still strong today.  Several of us still live locally and see each other on a regular basis.  We have served as groomsmen in each others’ weddings and have been there to support each other through life’s events…deaths of parents, births of children, succeses in our careers, etc.  \n     After high school, I began college and wanted to pursue a career in physical therapy.  With my grades, extracurricular activities and my SAT scores, I was accepted into the college of my choice.  However, my plans for my future changed, upon the birth of my daughter.  \n     My “high school sweetheart” and I were taken by surprise when we learned of our pregnancy as teenagers. While not planned, we accepted the situation and knew that having the baby was our only choice.   Upon the birth of our daughter, I transferred schools to be closer to my daughter and her mother.  I immediately took on a manual labor job at a local mill, in order to provide for our child.  For two years, I was able to work and go to school, but I then, found it too difficult to juggle.  I put my education on hold to work full time.  While the relationship with my daughter’s mother did not work out, I am proud of the relationship we still do have.  We have always parented together and put our daughter first.  I am fortunate in that we always got along for the sake of our daughter. This is not an easy thing to do when a child goes between two homes.   Both of our families embraced our daughter with open arms and have provided her with more love and support than one could imagine.  Today, my daughter is a teenager and is doing well.  She has grown into a beautiful young woman and is an important part of my life.  My wife treats her as if she was her own and vice versa.  The relationship the two of them have is one of closeness and love.  My daughter’s mother is, now married and has another child.  Due to our shared custody, we continue to get along and do what is best for our daughter.  We continue to communicate on a regular basis, for the good of our daughter.  While having a child, at such a young age was extremely difficult, I have been fortunate because of the love, support and sacrifices that have been given by our families.  My daughter often jokes that having 4 families (mine, my wife’s, her mother’s and her step-father’s) can be difficult to keep track of, but, come her birthday and Christmas, she is extremely spoiled and appreciative to have so many families! The situation couldn''t be better, and I consider myself very lucky that it worked out the way it did.\n     I have always been part of my daughter’s life.  I have seen her first steps, heard her first words and experienced her first days of school.  I provided her with her first pet. I have been there to lend support and offer praise, as she steers her way through her own life.  From Baptism, to First Holy Communion to Confirmation, I have been by her side in the church, as well.  I have been there to teach her how to ride a bike, to swim and to drive.  I have taken care of her when she was sick and pushed her to do better in school when I knew she could.  An avid horseback rider, my daughter is enrolled in a world class equine program, with aspirations of working with horses, in one capacity or another, as an adult.  I have supported her and helped to foster this talent, as she has grown.  An avid golfer, I have begun to teach my daughter the game.  I also enjoy cooking, and I enjoy the times she and I get to cook together.  These are experiences I have had with my daughter and I wish to share with another child, along with my life partner – my wife – by my side.  While I got to do these things, I was never able to do them as a family…a father, mother and child.  I look forward to the days ahead, as I get to experience fatherhood in a different way.  \n      With the apparent age difference between my daughter and a possible sibling, I do not foresee any difficulty in being the father to more than one child.  My daughter seems equally as excited to welcome a new sibling, or siblings, to our family.\n\n     As a person who became a teenage parent, I have full respect for any birthparent that makes the choice towards adoption.  I was lucky, in that I had A LOT of support (both financially and with family) to not have to make a difficult decision with my child.  As someone who wants a baby, with my wife, I also know the feeling of hope.  Adoption is a wonderful thing and I look forward to loving our adopted child with as much love as I have for my biological child.  \n      In addition, seeing how much my wife loves my biological child, I can see into our future with an adopted child. Having the same genetic line will make no difference to either of us.   We will both care for our child with endless love and support.  Because of the responsible and courageous decision of a birthparent, this will be possible for us.  I do not foresee any differences in parenting our adopted child versus my biological child.  I have enough love and support to give to both.  I am thankful for this.\n      In considering the important things that have happened in my life, my marriage and daughter, aside, I hope to use these things as a springboard for being a good parent to our baby.  My past achievements in sports have taught me lifelong lessons.  My hard work and success in sports serve as a metaphor to life.  If you work hard, you will find success.  Each sports achievement has been a significant part of my life.  More than the trophies, plaques and newspaper clippings that I have accumulated, I take with me the life lessons of hard work and perseverance.  The death of my fraternal grandfather was unexpected and weighed heavily on my heart.  Having been named after him…and my father…I always felt certain closeness to him…and obligation to make him proud.  As a teenager, I experienced his loss and I carry that with me today.  Because of it, I do not take advantage of family and having them around.  My family never wastes an opportunity to say...and show…our love for one another.       \n      Maintaining my childhood friendships into adulthood has been important to me.  Having no siblings, my friends feel like brothers to me.  While I have friendships from other stages of life, I can truly say that there is nothing like lifelong friends.  Those that knew me “when” and still stand with me today.  I am proud that we have maintained the close bond that we have.  To me, my friends are my extended family and I look forward to introducing our child to them.  \n      Beginning to work with my father in our family business has been significant to me on a few levels.  Not only have I learned a strong work ethic from my father, I have also learned to take pride in my work.  It is our family name on the business, and for that, I work even harder to do well.  My father has paved a small path for me, and I look forward to continuing down this road, as we transition from him, to me, in taking over the business.  Perhaps, I will one day, pass it along to my child.  \n      A significant event that did not happen was finishing my college degree.  While I am less than a year away from finishing, the daily demands of life got in the way of completing my education.  I sincerely regret not being able to finish, but the main reason behind not being able to finish has been worth it.  However, in being honest, it was not always “easy.”\n     These lessons from these significant life events in my life, are ones I want to carry on to my child.  Along with my wife, I want to teach my child the importance of hard work and perseverance, whether it be on or off a sports field.  I want to teach my child to value family and friendships. Often, the two can be intertwined.  I also want to teach the value of maintaining a pride in our family name.  It represents not just one, but all of us.  And finally, I want to teach my child the value of taking small opportunities to make bigger ones.  This includes attending and completing college.\n      Each of these things cannot happen alone.  They will be fostered and encouraged through the love, support and dedication that my wife and I, and our families will provide to our child.  We are excited to expand our family through adoption.  My heart, which has been filled throughout my life, is open and waiting to provide more love.\n', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'About Michael...A Father&#039;s Journey...', 2395, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1353469835, 0),

It has been a dream of mine for many years to adopt a child and I feel now is a wonderful time to raise a child. I am a Family Practice physician in Virginia who loves children. I spend my days taking care of other people''s children, now I am ready to have a child at my home. I cannot tell you how grateful I am that you have chosen this path of adoption. Without you, my dream would never become a reality. Thank you for your generous gift to myself and humanity. \n\nI, Ericka am a single adult who was raised in a small town. I have a younger brother who lives in California. Here in Virginia, my mother and I have a beautiful home in a suburban area. When I finish work, I love to participate in church activities, read, sew arts and crafts as well as practice martial arts. My most favorite thing to do is to sit on our back deck, listen to music on a warm summer’s day as the wind blows through my hair. \n\nI am strong in my catholic faith. I attend church regularly. While at church, I am active in parish activities and I am a soloist in the church choir. The best thing I can do with my voice is honor God with it. \n\nAll children are a blessing. You should know that your child will have a loving, safe and secure home. Along with myself, there will be lots of family and friends around at all times to make sure of this.  I promise to give all that I have in this world to make sure that your child will always know that he or she is deeply and unconditionally loved in every way.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read about me.

(735, 'Hello,\n\nWe are Belinda and Ryan and we would like to start out by saying that we THANK YOU for taking the time to learn about our family and considering us as an adoptive family. We truly admire and respect you for making this loving adoption plan for your child. We can not imagine how difficult this decision has been for you.  We truly admire your courage for making such a loving plan of adoption. If we are fortunate enough for you to entrust your child to us, we will make sure that your child understands the amazing love you had for him or her and the plan that you chose for him or her was one full of love. We would like to thank you for the great love you have for your child and the strength that has brought you to your adoption plan.\n\nOur story starts 12 years ago when a mutual friend decided we needed to meet. We began dating and fell deeply in love and married in 2004. We both wanted to have a family from the start as family is one of the most important things to us. We are both very close to our families. We have chosen adoption to grow our family as Belinda is unable to carry a child. We have had several pregnancy losses over the last few years. Adoption is close to our hearts as Belinda’s oldest brother is adopted. We are very blessed to have our families and close friends support our decision in adoption and welcoming a new child to our family. \n\nWe both grew up in small towns in southwestern Pennsylvania. We have a very strong, close and loving relationship with our parents, grandparents, and siblings. Belinda has 3 brothers and Ryan has 1 brother. Ryan’s mother is an elementary school teacher and Ryan’s father was an art teacher. Belinda’s father is a retired carpenter and Belinda’s mother was a homemaker and is now a store manager.  We have a niece, nephew and a god son that we love to spend as much time as possible with. They are the joy in our day.  We added a furry four legged child named Sassy to our family. She is a Westie. She joined our family almost 5 years ago. She is spoiled rotten and we cannot wait to have a child in the house for her to love. We both grew up with very close, loving and caring families. We are very blessed as both of our families get along together very well.  \n\nWe love to garden, go to the park, read, fish, play games, picnic, decorate for the holidays, go to movies, watch sports and play sports. We love any activities we can do as a family with extended family members to continue our close relationships.\n\nWe have a large three bedroom home in a small town with a big yard for children to play in. We live in a very close nit neighborhood with quite a few young children. We live in a very good school district. It is less than a mile from home. We both have very stable jobs. Our work places are no more than 10 miles from home and school. Belinda’s job allows her to have a very flexible schedule and work from home if need be. We are both financially ready to provide for a child. \n\nWe both would love nothing more than to grow our family by adding a child. Your child would be very loved and cared for. They would be provided every opportunity we could possibly give them in life. He or she will be given all the love and care in the world. There will also be a college education provided. We feel education is very important for a child. We would also like to bring a child up in the church. We would love to be able to teach a child about love, caring, respect, morals and values. We look forward to doing activities as a family and would love nothing more than to be able to raise a child with the same love and care we both were given and are still given from our families. Our families and close friends along with us are very excited about adding a new member to our family.\n \nWe thank you for taking the time to learn about our family. If you choose to place your child with us, he or she will be in a very nurturing and loving environment. They will be treasured! \n\nThank you again for considering our family in the loving adoption plan that you are making for your child.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'Birth Family Letter ', 2820, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1336009451, 0),

(747, 'Hello,\n\nWe are Belinda and Ryan and we would like to start out by saying that we THANK YOU for taking the time to learn about our family and considering us as an adoptive family. We truly admire and respect you for making this loving adoption plan for your child. We can not imagine how difficult this decision has been for you.  We truly admire your courage for making such a loving plan of adoption. If we are fortunate enough for you to entrust your child to us, we will make sure that your child understands the amazing love you had for him or her and the plan that you chose for him or her was one full of love. We would like to thank you for the great love you have for your child and the strength that has brought you to your adoption plan.\n\nOur story starts 13 years ago when a mutual friend decided we needed to meet. We began dating and fell deeply in love and married in 2004. We both wanted to have a family from the start as family is one of the most important things to us. We are both very close to our families. We have chosen adoption to grow our family as Belinda is unable to carry a child. We have had several pregnancy losses over the last few years. Adoption is close to our hearts as Belinda’s oldest brother is adopted. We are very blessed to have our families and close friends support our decision in adoption and welcoming a new child to our family. \n\n\nWe both grew up in small towns in southwestern Pennsylvania. We have a very strong, close and loving relationship with our parents, grandparents, and siblings. Belinda has 3 brothers and Ryan has 1 brother. Ryan’s mother is an elementary school teacher and Ryan’s father was an art teacher. Belinda’s father is a retired carpenter and Belinda’s mother was a homemaker and is now a store manager.  We have a niece, nephew and a god son that we love to spend as much time as possible with. They are the joy in our day.  We added a furry four legged child named Sassy to our family. She is a Westie. She joined our family almost 6 years ago. She is spoiled rotten and we cannot wait to have a child in the house for her to love. We both grew up with very close, loving and caring families. We are very blessed as both of our families get along together very well.  \n\n\nWe love to garden, go to the park, read, fish, play games, picnic, decorate for the holidays, go to movies, watch sports and play sports. We love any activities we can do as a family with extended family members to continue our close relationships.\n\nWe have a large three bedroom home in a small town with a big yard for children to play in. We live in a very close nit neighborhood with quite a few young children. We live in a very good school district. It is less than a mile from home. We both have very stable jobs. Our work places are no more than 10 miles from home and school. Belinda’s job allows her to have a very flexible schedule and work from home if need be. We are both financially ready to provide for a child. \n\nWe both would love nothing more than to grow our family by adding a child. Your child would be very loved and cared for. They would be provided every opportunity we could possibly give them in life. He or she will be given all the love and care in the world. There will also be a college education provided. We feel education is very important for a child. We would also like to bring a child up in the church. We would love to be able to teach a child about love, caring, respect, morals and values. We look forward to doing activities as a family and would love nothing more than to be able to raise a child with the same love and care we both were given and are still given from our families. Our families and close friends along with us are very excited about adding a new member to our family. \n\n\nWe thank you for taking the time to learn about our family. If you choose to place your child with us, he or she will be in a very nurturing and loving environment. They will be treasured! \n\nThank you again for considering our family in the loving adoption plan that you are making for your child.\n', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'Birth Family Letter ', 2820, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1352672626, 0),

Tim decided that rather than ask for her number, he would come back another day soon. Sabrina had also been thinking about what to do.

There was one catch though, in the middle of the field, there were two trees!

(841, 'Dear Birthparent,\n			\nAs I think about what I’d like to say to you, what I’d like for you to know about me, I first want to thank you for giving your child the ultimate gift of life, and for considering adoption. My husband and I previously adopted our son, Cormac, and because of that experience, my compassion and admiration for you could not be any stronger.  Through this letter and book, I hope you will gain an understanding of what kind of people Michael and I are, how our son would be as a big brother, and the kind of life that our children will lead.  Because we are parents already, we are in a unique position to show you our values as parents and as a family and what life would be like for your child.  It’s a tall order for just a small book, but I hope that it will be a good start so that you are informed and comfortable enough to seek more information about us if you choose to do so. With an open, honest dialogue between us, I know we could make your dreams for your baby come true.\n			\nI’ll start by telling you a little about me and my family.  I am 36 years old and used to work in the non-profit sector before deciding to become a stay at home mom.  I have a Bachelors of Science in sociology and women’s studies.  I grew up in a lower middle class family with an older brother and sister.  We didn’t have an excess of money, but enough to get by.  As a way of saving money, my dad grew a huge garden in our backyard.  My heart still melts thinking of being out in our garden, picking cucumbers and tomatoes, and eating as many green beans as I could right off the stalk.  We also had pear, fig, apple, and peach trees.  My dad would take a prideful picture of the prettiest apple to grow that season with us kids goofily smiling in the background. \n\nMy family is Catholic, and every Sunday we would go to church and then over to my grandparents for lunch.  My mom has 4 siblings and my dad has 5 siblings, and so with 29 cousins, you can imagine the ruckus we got into when we’d get together.  We made up so many games, some of which have been passed down to our children now.  I am incredibly close to my brother and sister.  We all live relatively close to each other and get together as frequently as possible.  Each of my siblings has 2 children, the oldest is 11 years old and the youngest is 6 years old.  They are young enough to want to play and be silly with my son, who is 2 years old, but old enough to treat him like a little brother and feel responsible for him.  It’s all very sweet to see.  For a long time, Michael and I were the only ones in both of our families without children; so we are known as the “fun” aunt and uncle. And now that we are parents, we’ve only become more playful with all the kids. If you have any concerns about how our families will treat an adopted child, let me put your fears to rest.  It absolutely does not matter to them how our children joined our family - only that they did.    Everyone is so happy for us, supportive, and pleased to see that we are on our way to completing our family by adopting our second, and last, child.\n			\nAs for me, I’d like to tell you a little about what my values are.  As a stay-at-home mom, I take my job very seriously in that I am building a family.  Every day, I think about what our values are, what kind of people we hope our children will be, what kind of parents we want to be, and then figure out ways to promote those values.  I want my children to always be learning - and I’m not necessarily referring to standardized schooling - but to always be studying things that they are interested in and that make them happy.  I will be honest and say that education is very important to me and I will raise my children to value a strong education; however, if that’s not in their cards, then I will support them to follow their desires.  I want my children to question everything and seek answers.  I want them to stand up for the underdog.  I want them to have the qualities of being able to put themselves in someone else’s shoes and to help others when needed.  I want them to be open and loving.  I want them to be polite.  I want them to have self-esteem and be proud of their endeavors, however small and trivial.  But, most of all... most of all... I am like every parent...  I am like you...  I want them to be happy.  \n\nI’d like to tell you a little bit about Michael and I and how we relate to each other, so you can know a little bit about how a child will see our relationship.  Michael, hands down, is the most supportive person I have ever met.  If I told him one day that I wanted to be a clown (don’t worry, I don’t), I have no doubt that he would reply by telling me that I should find a store that sells clown supplies and buy the big, round nose and silly clown shoes, and then that I should do an internet search for any clown schools in town, etc.  My point is that whenever I say I want to do something, he always puts a hand on my back to support me and push me towards that goal. I have known him since we were still in college and I have never known him to say something could not or should not be done.  And if he is like that with me and his friends, you can imagine what an amazing father he is!  When people ask me how I knew Michael was “The One,” I can tell them exactly.  I was walking home from class one day and I was thinking about him.  I was thinking about how since dating him, I had become interested in all these aspects of the world that I hadn’t learned about before.  And then I realized... He made me a better person.  He encouraged me to be the person I wanted to be.  I’m not saying that I wouldn’t have eventually done it on my own, but what I am saying is that I am so glad that I didn’t have to.  We have mutual respect for each other that I know everyone can see.  We do have disagreements, but we don’t “fight” and we never go to bed angry at one another.  We both understand that we have to work at our marriage every single day.  And I believe it shows.  Cormac sees us helping each other, working together, talking a lot, and hugging and giving kisses.  I hope, and expect, that our children will grow up to know what a healthy relationship looks like and will emulate it for themselves.  \n\nWe, also, value cultural opportunities and share a love of traveling.  For the past 6 years, we have gone on an international trip every year except this past year.  Our last trip, to Belgium and The Netherlands, was when Cormac was 9 months old.  We took a break this year as he was reaching his 2’s and we didn’t think that putting him through an 8-hour plane ride would be fair to him. When we become parents again, we will likely also take a break and in the meantime will enjoy traveling in the U.S.  We have traveled around England, Spain, Gibraltar, Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Mexico, Thailand, The Netherlands, and Belgium. Thailand was my personal favorite (it’s a beautiful country with the best food and the happiest people).  As a mom, I really enjoy traveling with children as there is heightened excitement experiencing it through their eyes. I look forward to sharing with my own children my life and the opportunities that were afforded to me; and to watch them find their own way of experiencing the world.\n			\nOur thoughts go out to you as you make this extremely difficult decision. We have the utmost respect for you. Whatever your circumstances may be, I commend you for considering adoption as I believe it is a reflection of the love you have for your baby. Should you choose us as the adoptive parents, we would love to have the opportunity to meet you and be as much a part of the pregnancy and birth as you feel comfortable with. We promise to raise your child with unconditional love in a safe and caring environment. Our dream is to become a complete family. Thank you for considering us.\n			\nThinking of you,\n\nKim', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'Birthparent Letter from Kim', 3215, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1341607643, 0),

Our families are as eager as we are to add new member.

Kim puts so much care and thinking into every decision about our family and son.\n<p/>\nOur son, Cormac, has grown from a small baby to a bundle of fun that loves exploring the world or just playing a game of chase for hours on end. He makes fast friends with almost anyone, rarely hesitating to strike up a conversation with someone or ask them to play with him. Without a doubt, Cormac will befriend and cherish his new sibling - I can see them spending their days playing in the house, at the park, and in the backyard - the two of them always ready to go visit with more friends.\n<p/>\nBeing a father has been more rewarding and enjoyable than I’d imagined. I was looking forward to parenthood a great deal, but I couldn’t anticipate how wonderful it’s been. Raising a child is a daunting, all consuming task, but with Kim, my family, and the life we’ve created for ourselves we have an excellent foundation to see us through all the trials and thrills of raising a family.

(844, '<p>Dear Birthparent,<br /><br />As I think about what I’d like to say to you, what I’d like for you to know about me, I first want to thank you for giving your child the ultimate gift of life, and for considering adoption. My husband and I previously adopted our son, Cormac, and because of that experience, my compassion and admiration for you could not be any stronger.  Through this letter and book, I hope you will gain an understanding of what kind of people Michael and I are, how our son would be as a big brother, and the kind of life that our children will lead.  Because we are parents already, we are in a unique position to show you our values as parents and as a family and what life would be like for your child.  It’s a tall order for just a small book, but I hope that it will be a good start so that you are informed and comfortable enough to seek more information about us if you choose to do so. With an open, honest dialogue between us, I know we could make your dreams for your baby come true.<br /><br />I’ll start by telling you a little about me and my family.  I am 36 years old and used to work in the non-profit sector before deciding to become a stay at home mom.  I have a Bachelors of Science in sociology and women’s studies.  I grew up in a lower middle class family with an older brother and sister.  We didn’t have an excess of money, but enough to get by.  As a way of saving money, my dad grew a huge garden in our backyard.  My heart still melts thinking of being out in our garden, picking cucumbers and tomatoes, and eating as many green beans as I could right off the stalk.  We also had pear, fig, apple, and peach trees.  My dad would take a prideful picture of the prettiest apple to grow that season with us kids goofily smiling in the background. <br /><br />My family is Catholic, and every Sunday we would go to church and then over to my grandparents for lunch.  My mom has 4 siblings and my dad has 5 siblings, and so with 29 cousins, you can imagine the ruckus we got into when we’d get together.  We made up so many games, some of which have been passed down to our children now.  I am incredibly close to my brother and sister.  We all live relatively close to each other and get together as frequently as possible.  Each of my siblings has 2 children, the oldest is 11 years old and the youngest is 6 years old.  They are young enough to want to play and be silly with my son, who is 2 years old, but old enough to treat him like a little brother and feel responsible for him.  It’s all very sweet to see.  For a long time, Michael and I were the only ones in both of our families without children; so we are known as the “fun” aunt and uncle. And now that we are parents, we’ve only become more playful with all the kids. If you have any concerns about how our families will treat an adopted child, let me put your fears to rest.  It absolutely does not matter to them how our children joined our family - only that they did.    Everyone is so happy for us, supportive, and pleased to see that we are on our way to completing our family by adopting our second, and last, child.<br /><br />As for me, I’d like to tell you a little about what my values are.  As a stay-at-home mom, I take my job very seriously in that I am building a family.  Every day, I think about what our values are, what kind of people we hope our children will be, what kind of parents we want to be, and then figure out ways to promote those values.  I want my children to always be learning - and I’m not necessarily referring to standardized schooling - but to always be studying things that they are interested in and that make them happy.  I will be honest and say that education is very important to me and I will raise my children to value a strong education; however, if that’s not in their cards, then I will support them to follow their desires.  I want my children to question everything and seek answers.  I want them to stand up for the underdog.  I want them to have the qualities of being able to put themselves in someone else’s shoes and to help others when needed.  I want them to be open and loving.  I want them to be polite.  I want them to have self-esteem and be proud of their endeavors, however small and trivial.  But, most of all... most of all...

(1528, '     Hi!  We are Steve and Tracy. We have been married for eleven years and the Lord has blessed us with three children through adoption.  Our family is very close and enjoys being together.  We spend a lot of time playing, going to playgrounds and parks, reading stories, and learning new things together. We are active members of our church and strive to follow Jesus. Our whole family is very excited about adopting again.  \n\n\n     We always knew we wanted to adopt again.  We love parenting and being with our family.  We decided to wait until all the children were also eager and ready for another sibling and our youngest was older.  Each child came to us at different times asking about a new sibling.

Joy is involved volunteering at the school and knows many teachers well.  After school, the kids work on “jobs”, homework, and playing outside.  Joy likes to cook and we usually eat dinner family style around the dinner table.  Dinner is followed by singing, playing a game, reading, or going on a walk with the dog.

However, video games are limited to weekends during the school year.  He is a bright, happy boy that wants to make everyone smile.  It’s his “superpower”.  He is an instant friend to anyone he meets.\nOn the weekends we like to watch movies and play games as a family.  Sometimes we go yard sale-ing on the weekend or we go on dates.  Sometimes Chad and Joy go on a date and we get a baby-sitter.  Almost as frequently, Chad or Joy gets to take one kid out on their own special date.  We love doing that.  We also go to church on the weekend and meet with our small group.

For international adoptions, the figure was 66%.</p>\n<hr /><p><a href="http://lawadoption.com/faq.html#top"><img src="http://lawadoption.com/images/top.gif" border="0" alt="Back to Top" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><a></a>Can I adopt if I''m over 40?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, there are no age limits in a private adoption. Check with your adoption attorney to see if private adoption is available in your state.</p>\n<p>The age limits for an international adoption vary by country, but typically are 50 or greater. Some domestic agencies do impose age restrictions, usually at age 45.</p>\n<hr /><p><a href="http://lawadoption.com/faq.html#top"><img src="http://lawadoption.com/images/top.gif" border="0" alt="Back to Top" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><a></a>Isn''t it really expensive to adopt?</strong></p>\n<p><img src="http://lawadoption.com/images/pic13.jpg" alt="LawAdoption.com" width="200" height="200" />It''s true that adoption should be free, however, protecting your family''s interests means that you have to hire professionals to help you comply with your state''s adoption laws. If you adopt overseas, you have the added expenses of traveling to the foreign country, meeting USCIS requirements to bring your child home, and legal fees in the foreign country.</p>\n<p>There is help available. The federal Adoption Tax Credit provides up to $12,650 for qualifying expenses paid to adopt an eligible child in 2012. The credit is indexed for inflation and will increase annually. Eligible expenses include adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, traveling expenses (including amounts spent for meals and lodging) and other expenses directly related to your adoption.</p>\n<p>There is an income limit for this credit.</p>\n<p><img src="http://lawadoption.com/images/pic2.jpg" alt="LawAdoption.com" width="200" height="200" />Further, many large employers offer adoption assistance. Those payments may qualify for exclusion from your income for tax purposes in addition to the tax credit. You may exclude up to $12,650 from your income in 2012. So, for example, if your employer offers adoption assistance payments of $5,000 and your total adoption related expenses were $17,650, you could claim $12,650 as a tax credit AND exclude $5,000 from your income. However, if your total expenses were $12,650, you could not take the credit and the exclusion-the same expenses cannot be counted twice. The income limits for the tax credit also apply to the exclusion.</p>\n<p>If you adopt a special needs child or a child from foster care, the cost is usually less and a monthly adoption subsidy is often available to help pay for things like remedial educational services, physical therapy and medical care. You may also take the entire amount of the tax credit even if you don’t incur those costs.</p>\n<hr /><p><a href="http://lawadoption.com/faq.html#top"><img src="http://lawadoption.com/images/top.gif" border="0" alt="Back to Top" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><a></a>I''ve heard horror stories of birth parents "reclaiming" their children after several years-does that happen very often?</strong></p>\n<p><img src="http://lawadoption.com/images/pic16.jpg" alt="LawAdoption.com" width="200" height="200" />It''s very rare. Adoption is governed by state law and if you and the birth parents work with licensed adoption professionals, your risk is small.</p>\n<p>In Virginia, there is a "fall-through" rate of 1 to 2% after the child is born, and that usually happens in the first three days after birth. The "revocation period" or time which the birth parent has to "change their mind" after consenting to the adoption, varies by state as well. For a private adoption in Virginia, the birth parent''s consent is irrevocable seven days after signing. If a birth parent places through an agency, consent is revocable once all three of the following have occurred: seven days have passed since the signing of the entrustment agreement, the child is ten days old, and the child is placed in the physical custody of adoptive parents. An adoption cannot be challenged for any reason 6 months after a Final Order of Adoption is granted by a Circuit Court in the Commonwealth.</p>\n</td>\n</tr></tbody></table>', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'Adoptive Parent FAQ', 3520, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'text', 1344453162, 0),

We spend as much time as we can with family and friends and try to include them in on our favorite pastimes.  We share a love of baseball. Regina’s Dad instilled that in her when she was very little. He is a baseball coach in the community.  One of our very first dates was to a Twins game at the Dome.  We continue to cheer them on even when they are losing. We try to get to a few games each season and really love the new stadium. \n\n\n\n We also love to cheer on the Nebraska Huskers, especially the football team.  Weston’s family, being mostly from Nebraska, is HUGE Husker fans, so really what choice did she have but to become a fan?  We have even traveled down to Lincoln to take in a game and every year we get together with friends and family to watch games and wear our Red, White and Black.\n\n\n\n We share a love for movies and enjoy going to them or having movie and popcorn nights at home.

We both remember going with our families growing up in our pajamas and would love to share that experience with our own child someday. \n\n\n\nWe also like to travel. We like going on short road trips to visit family or friends as well as flying to places we haven’t yet seen.  We also usually go camping a couple times each summer or early fall.  Our favorite all time trip was to Disneyworld on our Honeymoon.  Regina had been there a few times before, but it was Weston’s first trip and we loved every minute of it.

Looking at different profiles is an important step in this journey and we hope that they will help guide you to make a decision that will benefit both you and your child.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Our Journey:</strong><br />We met during high school in 2001 and have been together as a couple ever since. Andrew popped the question during the summer of 2005 while we were visiting Duluth, our favorite place to visit in Minnesota. We tied the knot in June of 2007, settled into a two bedroom apartment, and enjoyed having a place to call our own. Soon after, Bridget was offered a full-time position and was nearing graduation; we started exploring different options for purchasing our first home. In the early spring of 2008, we purchased 3.5 acres of bare land from a family friend and custom designed a 1,900 square foot modular home with a full basement and two-stall garage. A few months later, family and friends helped us move from our tiny two bedroom apartment to our new home. Our home is located ¼ mile from Andrew’s parents’ farm and about 20 miles from Bridget’s parents.<br /><br />We have two dogs. Billy, an English Shepherd, joined our family in the spring of 2008 when he was a year and a half. We both felt that Billy needed a companion, so in the spring of 2009 we brought JJ home. JJ is a husky mix and was six months old when we picked him up. It is always a joy to see how excited they are to see us when we get home and they love watching their little sister (Halley) wave to them from the window. <br /><br />In the summer, we enjoy camping at state parks and spending weekends out at the lake. We both enjoy knee boarding, tubing, swimming, and playing at the park. We are excited to get active with local ECFE activities and other programs that community has to offer to families. <br /><br />We are members of a small Lutheran church located five miles from our home. Andrew is on the board of deacons and Bridget participates in the ladies’ aid group. Our values and beliefs will be passed on to our children through baptism, confirmation, and attending church on a regular basis. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>God’s Plan: </strong><br />Good health, family, friends, and a place to call home are just a few of the blessings that God has given us. We continue to put our trust in him and we know that in all things, God works for the good of those who love him.</p>\n<p><br />Family has always been an important aspect of our lives and starting a family of our own has always been one of our top priorities. Soon after we were married, we decided we wanted to start our family and after a year of actively trying, we started seeking infertility treatment. We sought treatment for two years and dealt with it by having trust in God and by accepting the fact that everything happens for a reason. Infertility has made us stronger, both individually and as a couple, and has brought us even closer together. We believe God has led us down this path and that He never gives us a situation we can’t handle. With His help and His guidance, along with support from family and friends, we knew we could make it through anything.</p>\n<p><br /><br /><strong>Our daughter’s story: </strong><br />On June 15, 2011, our life forever changed. Halley Isabelle was born. Words can’t begin to explain the joy we had in our hearts when we got to hold her for the very first time. She weighed 7 lbs. 11 oz., was 21 ¼ inches long and is absolutely beautiful. We were able to bring her home from the hospital the following day, which happened to be our wedding anniversary. We continue to keep in touch with Halley’s birthmother and immediate family through pictures and letters. There isn’t a day that goes by that we don’t think of them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We are amazed at how fast the last couple months have gone and can’t wait for her to have a sibling to grow up with. She loves playing and chasing her cousins around the house and learning new things from them. Grandma and grandpa enjoy spoiling her with new toys and clothes; our house has quickly filled up. Since the day she was born she has always been a strong little girl and continues to be in the top percentile for her height and weight. It amazes us how fast she can pick up on things and we love watching her grow into a unique individual. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Us as parents:</strong><br />Through adoption, we were able to start our family and we are now looking to expand our family. We are hoping to adopt one or two more children and do not have a gender or nationality preference. No matter what the future holds, we will love our children with all our hearts and will fight to give them everything that they deserve. They will be our number one priority and we will do everything possible so that they can live a healthy and enjoyable life.</p>\n<p><br /><br />Bridget plans on taking eight weeks off again for maternity leave. Andrew will continue to work on the farm and be a stay-at-home dad. This allows us to give our children the attention they deserve and we have the peace of mind knowing they are always in good hands. Once a week, they will visit Bridget’s parents and spend the day at their house to give Andrew an opportunity to get a few extra things done outside and at the farm.<br /><br />As a family, we will continue to take vacations and camping trips. We look forward to showing them how to ride their first bike, how to catch a ball, and even drive their first car. We will be there for them through the good times and the bad and will help guide them down a path that is fitting for them as individuals. It will be important for us to teach our children right from wrong, from the beginning, and explain to them why we feel the way we do. It is also important for us to follow through on what we say and to practice what we preach. <br /><br />We both believe that we have had strong morals and values instilled in us by our parents and families, and we will pass those values on to our children. We want our children to have every opportunity to express themselves, and that includes being able to think for themselves and have their own ideas. Honesty, respect, trust, faith, and love are just a few of the values we will instill in our children.</p>\n<p><br />We believe that if our children are told early on that they are adopted, there will be plenty of opportunities to answer their questions. We plan on letting them know that they are adopted before they can ever understand what that means. There’s no reason to hide it. If questions arise before we’ve decided they are mature enough to understand, we will answer them at that point. If no questions are asked, we will still explain to them their life and their background and how they became a part of our family when we feel our children can comprehend, at least to a degree, what we are talking about. The fact that they are adopted is something that we will never hide from them. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being adopted, and we’ll be sure that our children know this.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Thinking of you:</strong></p>\n<p>Although we are on different sides of the road, we are all traveling down the same road. If it is your wish, we are willing to meet with you before or after placement. This would give all of us the opportunity to get to know each other better; you could learn more about us as a couple and we could learn more about you so that we can one day share with our child. We can’t even begin to understand the emotions you are feeling and we recognize the magnitude of your decision. We admire you for considering adoption and will keep you in our thoughts and prayers and look forward to answering any questions you may have for us. Your child is a blessing from God and we know that you will make a decision that is best for your child.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Andrew, Bridget &amp; Halley</strong></p>', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'Birthparent Letter', 3546, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'text', 1345250377, 0),

Words cannot express the respect and admiration that we have for you and the decision you are making. \n\nOur greatest hope is to raise a child in a happy, loving home where they have every opportunity to enjoy the good things in life. It is our desire to allow your child to explore their interests, growing into the individual they have the will to become. We will guide your child to become a caring, compassionate and respectful person. Most of all, your child will be loved.

We believe that being friends prior to dating has been a strength in our relationship. \n\nAfter we were married, we made our home on the family farm. This is the same place that Brandon lived for most of his life. We live 11 miles from town, and we feel raising children on the farm and in the country is one of the best places to raise a child. Teresa also grew up living in the country. We are very fortunate to live in a community that excels in education.

(964, 'Hi, My name is George. I was born and raised on Long Island,  my parents live about ten minutes from us. I am a twin, my brother lives in Fl and is a sheriffs deputy. I have an older sister ,she is married , is an accountant and lives close by. My family owns 2 restaurants, which I worked in for many years while growing up. I now work full time in the automobile industry and Kelly and I also own our own business. \nI guess you could say I grew up in your average middle class working family, but at the same time I feel it was so much more. My mom  was always right "there" for us for our every single need or issue or proud moment. Actually she still is , to this very day. Although we are all grown and have our own lives and our own families,if you just "mention " something you might need or pan on getting or if there is something that needs to be done. Well it seems it magically appears or gets done. She truly cares about our happiness and will do anything for any of us at the drop of a hat. My dad, well he is the quieter kind but he has instilled in all of us a hard work ethic and in my brother and I that it is our responsibility to provide, take care of and protect our families. He has taught us you do what you need to do to provide for you family. He has worked many a 15-16 hour day in his time to ensure we had it all plus more. He had us helping out in restaurants from a young age teaching us that if you want something , you earn it. I am of the same values. Kelly and Zackary are my family , I cherish them both and can''t imagine my life without them. I would do  anything for either one of them. Working full time of course provides a regular salary and benefits but I was determined I wanted more security for our family. I started our business with this in mind and while it can be long hours and hard work at times,knowing my family is taken care of  is all the motivation I need.\nMy parents, my brother and my sister are all thrilled we have chosen to adopt. They know we have longed for another child for several years and the decision to adopt a precious one feel right to both Kelly and I. We adore our son and how he is turning into a great young man.  We would feel honored to be entrusted by someone to raise their child. \nI know Kelly has explained how our relationship grew. It felt natural and meant to be right from the beginning. Zackary from the very start has been a joy in my life. He was a happy, well balanced smart and obviously much loved child when I met him. Kelly would just glow with love and pride for him , I couldn''t help but want to be part of that family instantly. \nNow we would love to add another to this family. We have the all in this world to give to a child and we can''t wait to start our life with them.\n', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'ABOUT GEORGE', 3624, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1345698019, 0),

Only one problem. There were 200 miles between us! It did make dating a challenge, but we didn’t let it stop us. Many weekends were spent traveling. Two years later we married in Milwaukee.\n\nOur neighborhood is quiet and we have great neighbors; many with children.  Time is spent in our garden taking care of flowers and a variety of vegetables.  There are large, open parks nearby that we enjoy.  Plus, we take advantage of the local bike trails.\n\nWe have enjoyed our years together and are looking forward to starting our own family and sharing our love with a child. Being able to provide a strong education in combination with Christian values is important to us.  Also, both of us grew up in households with a stay-at-home parent and we would like to do the same.\n\nOur families are very supportive of our decision to adopt.  Both sets of grandparents look forward to having another grandchild to spoil.  The holidays and many weekends are spent at the lake house with Theresa’s parents or in Michigan with Greg’s parents and sister’s family.\n\nWe are open to discussing the extent of openness in the adoption plan.

(969, 'Both George and I felt it was important that birth moms know about the big brother,because he is going to have a very active and important role in this babies life. First let me say, he has known for many years we were trying to welcome a new addition into the family and has always been very positive about it, but we never brought into the forefront of any real discussions with him. So when we decided we really wanted to try to actively look for a baby to welcome into our family, we of course sat down to talk together as a family. Zack is simply overjoyed at prospect of being a big brother. He is an intellegent ,caring ,thoughtful, generous young man. He is an honor student , works wit our local handicapped ice hockey team for kids and volunteers with many activities at his catholic high school.he has also worked as an afterschool tutor for younger kids.  He spends time teaching kids mainly with Down''s syndrome how to skate and play hockey. I always sit and watch , and I can never tell who has the biggest smile. Him or the youngster he is helping. Now in the last couple of weeks when I am either working on this site or writing ads or on the phone with agencies or doing any kind of task involved with the adoption process, well I find him casually looking over my shoulder to see how its going. He is also helping us make our family album for our birthmom. I wish I could explain his excitement for this in words more accurately, but I can say that whenever I mention anything to do with a little one coming to us, well he gets this beaming smile across his face.

(987, '<p>Dear Birthparent: <br /><br />We are extremely happy at the thought of being parents and look forward to the joys of raising a child. We are happy and content with our lives except for one thing. We really want to be a mom and a dad. Unfortunately, God has a different plan for us. Words cannot express the respect and admiration that we have for you and the decision you are making. <br /><br />Our greatest hope is to raise a child in a happy, loving home where they have every opportunity to enjoy the good things in life. It is our desire to allow your child to explore their interests, growing into the individual they have the will to become. We will guide your child to become a caring, compassionate and respectful person. Most of all, your child will be loved. We are excited to share our values and lessons we learned from our parents and extended family. The values of a good education, working hard for what you have, learning to appreciate the simple things in life, and most of all, treating others with kindness and respect. <br /><br />The story of our life together began some 20 years ago. We met our freshman year of college, when a mutual friend introduced us. We became friends, and it wasn''t until our junior year in college that we began dating. We dated four years before we married. We married in August 1997, and will have been married 15 years this August. We believe that being friends prior to dating has been a strength in our relationship. <br /><br />After we were married, we made our home on the family farm. This is the same place that Brandon lived for most of his life. We live 11 miles from town, and we feel raising children on the farm and in the country is one of the best places to raise a child. Teresa also grew up living in the country. We are very fortunate to live in a community that excels in education. Our schools have been recognized for their outstanding efforts in academics, scholastics, and athletics. In our community there are many activities for the children to participate in. We feel a balance between school/community activities, along with the life skills learned living on a farm will enhance the children we raise. <br /> <br />Brandon is doing what he loves best, and has always wanted to do since he was a child, be part of the family farm. Our farm consists of raising cattle and growing crops. Brandon also operates his own liquid and dry feed cattle business. I can''t forget to mention that we also have two dogs, numerous cats, and yes, even chickens. <br />There''s no doubt that we both love children. Teresa is lucky enough to spend majority of her day with kids. Being an elementary teacher the past 14 years, has always been a dream and goal of hers since she was in the 1st grade. She is currently teaching 5th and 6th Grade Science. She wouldn''t trade teaching for anything. <br /><br />A value that we were brought up with is our faith in God. We are not ones to go out and preach to others, but we are a strong believer in God and his works. It is our plan for raise our children within the Faith of the Catholic Church. <br /><br />A question has been asked of us numerous times. "How many children do you have?" Often times we answer 120, being the students at school. I will be the first to tell you that I love the children I work with everyday, and we enjoy being around other children, but we anxiously await for the day we can tell others that we have a child of our own. We realize and understand that God has a plan for us be blessed with a family. It may not be the exact plan we had in mind, but we believe that somewhere out there is a child that would become part of our family and be loved. <br />As we close this letter, let us leave you with this:"Children are a Blessing." Whether or not you choose use as parents for your child, please let us know that our thoughts and prayers are with you. We wish you peace with your decision and hope that you will be comforted with the knowledge that your child will be deeply loved and cared for and will be raised to know of the loving sacrifice you made for them. <br />God bless you, as you are making this important decision.<br /><br />With Best Wishes, <br /><br /><br />Brandon &amp; Teresa</p>', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'Letter', 3352, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'text', 1347409167, 0),

(1055, 'We met in 1999 when we both attended the same poetry group in college. Although our poems were pretty dreadful, and our haircuts even worse, we saw something in each other from the very beginning. We became close friends as part of a larger group of friends and began dating in 2001. We were married in 2005.\n\nWe really are each other’s best friends. For us, that means that there’s no one we’d rather be with for the fun stuff (travel, hanging out with other friends, lazy summer mornings spent strolling around town) or the not-fun stuff (cleaning the kitchen, taking the car to the mechanic’s, going to the grocery store). On a typical night, you’ll find us sitting at a coffee shop. Mike will be slowly sipping his black coffee, playing on his laptop and making Char laugh. Char will be reading a novel- interrupting herself every few pages or so to update Mike on what the characters are doing  – or to share a story from her day.\n\nWe are a couple with 1,000 nicknames for each other and a million inside jokes. Mike makes an amazing cup of coffee (it’s quite a process) and takes beautiful photographs (many of which you can see on this site). Char loves to try new recipes, reads a ridiculous number of novels, and has mastered the art of baking the perfect chocolate chip cookie.\n\nWe know our life will change immeasurably when our baby comes and although we love our lives now we are so ready to become parents!\n\n      \n\nChar grew up in a large, loud family in Alabama. Her childhood is a blur of popsicles, family road trips and time spent playing with her three older sisters who were (and still are!) her closest friends. She cherishes the memories of exploring her hometown with her mom, putting on plays in her grandmother’s living room, and being dropped off at school every morning by her dad saying “I love you, mama will pick you up!” The sense of stability and joy was pervasive in her childhood, and she hopes to build that kind of home for her kids.\n\nMike grew up a half a world away in Poland, but actually our childhoods were very similar. Mike remembers long days playing with his sister, cousins and neighborhood friends. He was an active and adventurous kid…running through fields, playing lots of soccer, and dreaming up big adventures for himself and his friends. Mike’s greatest childhood adventure came when his family moved to the U.S. when he was 12. His parents decided to immigrate to Maryland to pursue more freedom and a better life. Mike quickly made Maryland his home – making new friends, learning English and eagerly exploring his new surroundings.\n\nFaith was an extremely important part of both of our lives as kids, and remains so today. Both of our families are Catholic and we learned a love of the faith from an early age through the example of our parents. We both feel that our faith is one of the greatest gifts our parents gave us and intend to pass that along to our kids.\n\nWe have always dreamed of becoming parents. Facing infertility together as a couple has made us stronger and more certain than ever that what we most want is to become parents. After months of prayer, thought, and conversation, we embraced adoption as our path to parenthood. We are so thrilled to be taking concrete steps down that path- come join us for the journey!', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'Meet Us ', 4667, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1351471661, 0),

(1073, '      I love to travel. I am a firm believer that “travel is the only thing you buy, that makes you richer”. Learning about the history, architecture, different cultures, and regional food is a lot of fun and I hope to continue seeing other places in the future.\n\n      When we are home I love to work on different projects. I am very interested in interior design and I love to watch HGTV. We bought our home over 5 years ago and since then it is an ongoing project. Tom sometimes jokes that I repaint a room before the old color has a chance to dry. As much as he exaggerates, I do like to change things around. When we are finishing one project there is usually another one on my mind. I think that scares Tom a little bit, or maybe he just used to it by now. \n\n      My newest hobby, which I discovered about three years ago, is gardening. When we bought our house the front and back yard looked like a disaster. Now, instead of overgrown weeds and bushes, we can enjoy flowers, evergreens and beautiful trees. This year I even tried to grow some herbs, fruits and veggies and that gave me a lot of satisfaction (and lots of cucumbers). I love to spend time outside and really enjoy working in our garden. Whenever weather is nice we eat outside. Lola also likes playing outside; although she is the only retriever I know who does not want to retrieve anything!\n\n      I also like to bake. That is something I did with my Mom since I was little. She always let me “help” her but at the same time I learned a lot too. This is one of my hobbies which I think Tom enjoys the most! \n\n      I cannot imagine my life without different forms of art.  There is nothing better to relax then reading a good book. There are some books which will stay with me forever. They can inspire, make you think, or cry, or just carry you someplace else after a long day. Music has the same power for me. Depending on the mood, I listen to everything from classical music through country, pop, rock and hip-hop. I love to watch ballet or to see exhibits and living close to big city makes it all much easier.  \n\n      As much as I like to read I hate to exercise! There are however some activities I do enjoy like yoga, biking, snowboarding, and talking long walks with Lola. \n', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'Interests and Hobbies of Agnes', 3733, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1351823492, 0),

Tom’s parents moved to the US with him and his younger sister almost 20 years ago. His father and his sister live in Chicago with her family. Tom’s Mom has passed away suddenly a few years ago and she is greatly missed. All our siblings have children. While the youngest one is just 19 months, the oldest one turned 19 this year and went to college. We are very blessed to have people in our lives who showed us what unconditional love means, and who have always been there for us. We will be forever grateful for that and we hope to be as good parents for our children as our parents were for us. Our families are very important to us and we try to spend as much time with them as we can.

There are two beautiful parks very close to our home\n \n​\n \nThere are many things we are looking forward to doing as a family like, watching Fourth of July fireworks from our backyard, teaching our child to play baseball, exploring the children’s museum, swimming, fishing up north and watching him or her grow and learn; just to name a few!\n', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'ABOUT US', 4736, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1352066195, 0),

(1116, 'My name is Brad. My wife''s name is Amanda.\nWe met over twelve years ago while working late on projects in college. \nAmanda says that she liked my creative flair, and that I couldn’t believe there was life outside of studying.\n \nI liked her daring, drive, and intelligence. Oh, did I mention that she is absolutely gorgeous? I also figured that I didn''t have a shot with her.\n \nSince we are being, ''all cards on the table'' honest here, I''ll tell you that Amanda can be a bit impatient at times. Lucky for us, this was one of those times. She walked into the class I was supervising and asked, "So…when are you going to ask me out?" It is exceedingly difficult to supervise a class of Freshmen when a gorgeous girl walks into the class, and calls you out. So, here I am, put up or shut up time. I put up, and took her on our first date,,,To meet my entire family.\n\nDid I mention that Amanda can be extremely patient, as well? Again, lucky for us, this was one of those times. I don''t know what I was thinking, but I subjected her to my mom, dad, brother, sister, their spouses, my aunts, uncles, cousins, and THEIR spouses. Don''t get me wrong, my family is great, but that''s a lot for anyone to take. We also narrowly avoided getting sucked up by a tornado on the way home. First date, no kidding, and she stayed. I met Amanda''s family a month, or so, later. Her dad just wanted to be sure that my intentions were honorable. Something about owning a lot of land, a front loader, and no one missing me...but that is neither here nor there. A couple of years later, we were married in Amanda’s hometown. It must be providence.\nFast forward 10+ years. We have found a great city in which to live, and work. We created successful and truly rewarding careers in product design (more on this in another section). We adopted three wonderful cats, bought and remodeled our first home, and traveled all over the world. We also bought our next house, enjoy golfing, picked up fishing, and archery (more on that later, too).\n \n\nIt is safe to say that we have happy and fulfilling lives, but we have always known that something is missing. We wanted to share all of it with kids. We tried to do just that for years, but one miscarriage led to another and another and, well, you get the picture. The specialists were called in, tears were shed, deep seeded beliefs were questioned, and something was made very clear. We still want a family, but it isn''t going to happen that way,\n \nWe are both excited to welcome an adopted child into our home to love, cherish, teach, and maybe spoil a bit. This decision must be very difficult for you, but we have so much love that we want to share. Please know that you will make a family like us so happy, and that you will be giving your child a wonderful safe home.\n', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'The Story of Us', 3769, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1352511443, 0),

It must be providence.</p>\n<p>Fast forward 10+ years. We have found a great city in which to live, and work. We created successful and truly rewarding careers in product design (more on this in another section). We adopted three wonderful cats, bought and remodeled our first home, and traveled all over the world. We also bought our next house, enjoy golfing, picked up fishing, and archery (more on that later, too).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is safe to say that we have happy and fulfilling lives, but we have always known that something is missing. We wanted to share all of it with kids. We tried to do just that for years, but one miscarriage led to another and another and, well, you get the picture. The specialists were called in, tears were shed, deep seeded beliefs were questioned, and something was made very clear. We still want a family, but it isn''t going to happen that way,</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We are both excited to welcome an adopted child into our home to love, cherish, teach, and maybe spoil a bit. This decision must be very difficult for you, but we have so much love that we want to share. Please know that you will make a family like us so happy, and that you will be giving your child a wonderful safe home.</p>', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'the story of us', 3769, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'text', 1352512928, 0),

(1253, 'Born on March 10, 2008, Nate was a healthy baby. We are very grateful that he has also enjoyed a happy, healthy first four+ years of life. This is a very loving and lively boy, who laughs a lot and makes others laugh—saying and doing the funniest things each day. His imagination has been growing by leaps and bounds lately, so you never know when he might suddenly board a spaceship heading to a far-off planet … and take you with him!\n\n\nInterests: Nate has frequent play dates with his school pals and many of our friends’ children—he gets along well with other kids and has some super-fun friends. Aside from lots of physical activity, Nate enjoys playing games and building things (e.g., with legos, magnetic blocks), drawing (lots of space-related stuff), and books. He’s got lots of interests but seems especially drawn to things like the ocean, bugs, cars, big buildings, electricity, weather, outer space, etc. He also loves riding in planes, trains, and boats too.\n\n\nOutside the home: Nate is enrolled in a wonderful preschool, where he’s been going since he was 2 years old. The kids there get a lot of individualized attention and it shows—they''ve formed this beautiful tight-knit little group that seems not to exclude anyone. For more than a year, Nate’s been doing gymnastics (which he totally loves) every Monday. He’ll have swim lessons again this spring (indoor, at the community center) and summer (at our neighborhood pool), and we plan also try Tae Kwon Do, soccer, or T-ball. Last spring, he started going to a speech therapist for some minor pronunciation issues. He’s making good progress and will soon be going less frequently. He certainly loves talking and is a very expressive child, sharing his thoughts and feelings proudly.\n\n\nAs a future big brother: It has always been so gratifying and touching to see how gentle Nate is with babies and young children; he seems to instinctively “adjust” to their size and abilities. We are super excited to see him and his younger brother or sister together—having fun, learning, and growing together.

Being an Italian woman, she enjoys cooking tasty traditional meals (especially when our friends come over)....and using her Italian flavor when it comes to fashion....And now, with these, she gives her best when dealing with our daughter.

I also want to be a teacher to them, to help form their beliefs, morals, and attitudes.  I also want to be a disciplinary as needed.  I want them to grow up knowing right and wrong and choosing right.  I want to help them be the best version of themselves.  \n<br /><br />\nHowever, it is the little day-to-day things I daydream about.  I am so excited for bath time, reading stories, and snuggling.  I cannot wait to bake with them.  Letting them be creative with decorating cookies, or topping homemade pizzas are memories just waiting to be made.  I cannot wait to see their big grins when they get their first "under doggie" on the swing set.

For two of those years she worked one on one with a male student with severe autism.\n\nMy daughter has shown huge improvements since Ms. Burns has been her teacher and case manager.  Ali would shut down and not do her work at school.  Since Ms. Burns has been her teacher, she does her work and participates in her class.  Ali would argue a lot at school with adults and students.  At home, she would go into tantrums.  Ms. Burns helped our family with a behavior plan for home.  Whitney gave Ali permission to call her when Ali is angry and frustrated.  Ms. Burns always calms Ali down and Ali always apologizes to family members.\n\nWhitney has been a miracle worker for my daughter and family.  She has gone out of her way over and above any teacher I have ever known.  Whitney is a very special, caring, patient and loving person.  She started the Special Needs Talent Show at school that brought tears to my eyes.  Whitney’s students served a home cooked Thanksgiving lunch to staff members.  Each student had a job duty to perform under Whitney’s supervision.  Whitney has been doing community based instruction for seven years.  She started a special needs basketball team for her students.  Whitney, also, is on the principal advisory committee.  She received her second certification at Eastern Kentucky University on inter-disciplinary early childhood in Special Education.\n\nWhitney had a wonderful Christmas party for her students and family members at her home.

Shortly after moving, she met Nathan while proofreading his papers for a business class he was taking at the local junior college.  He took her out to dinner to say thank you for her help.  It ended up being a 5 hour dinner.  The courtship was a short one; it was about 5 months.  They got married in January of 2005.  They found out that Tammy was pregnant in late April of 2005.  Clara was born at 38 weeks on December 30, 2005, after a very challenging pregnancy.  After a very difficult and scary stay in the Newborn ICU, Clara was allowed to go home in mid January 2006.  Nathan and Tammy went on to have two more pregnancies that both ended in miscarriages.  It was not easy or according to several doctors, safe for Tammy to get pregnant and carry a baby to term.  They decided on open adoption through Catholic Social Services.  After almost 6 months of working on the process and having only one meeting left to complete the homestudy, Tammy became pregnant unexpectedly (it was never an issue to get pregnant, just to keep the baby and not cause problems with Tammy’s health).  They inactivated the adoption.  After almost 35 weeks of a very hard and complicated pregnancy, Mark was born on August 6, 2009.  He was allowed to come home after 2 ½ weeks in the Newborn ICU.  He came home on oxygen due to his prematurity and getting pneumonia in the hospital a few days after birth.  Today, both children are healthy.  Due to the risk to any future biological children and Tammy''s health if she got pregnant again, Nathan and Tammy made the permanent decision through surgery not to get pregnant again.  Nathan and Tammy both wanted to complete the open adoption process they had started.  In late 2012, they felt the time was right.  They hope to have a little boy or girl to add to their family as well as create a relationship with any birth parent that would like to.

With the help of an IEP, she is successful in school.  Clara is a very sweet child that likes to please others.  Clara''s favorite things include special time with just mommy or daddy, playing baby dolls (she also LOVES real babies), and using her Ipad for both learning and games.\n\nMark is our 3 1/2 year old son.  He was born on August 6, 2009.  Again, the pregnancy was complicated.  He was born at 35 weeks for his safety as Tammy''s body was attacking him.  Today, Mark is healthy and normal functioning.  He loves to go to a home preschool and make projects.  Mark will go to the Catholic school Clara is in next year for a more formal preschool program.  His personality is very loving, but also very ornery.  The saying "he''s all boy" definitely applies to Mark.

Buddy is about 11 years old now, but he''s still very involved with the kids.  He''s especially close to Clara.  When in utero, Clara used to kick after Buddy would bump his nose into Tammy''s stomach just hard enough to make Clara kick.  It never hurt Tammy or Clara, but became a comfort to Tammy as Clara didn''t move much, making Tammy nervous that Clara was ok.  Buddy thinks of himself as a member of the family as does Nathan, Tammy, and the kids.  If it were up to him, he''d have a spot at the dinner table (notice I said if it were up to him).  He''s very watchful over both children and is quick to tattle to Tammy or Nathan if the kids are fighting/playing too rough.  Buddy is extremely important to the whole family.  When Nathan and Tammy moved the family 23 miles into a school district that would provide better services for Clara, it was never a question that they would only rent from a landlord that allowed Buddy (as at that time, their house hadn''t sold in the other school district).

I believe that families are created in different ways, and for many, adoption is a great option. I am familiar and comfortable with adoption because my life has already been blessed immeasurably by several adopted children. These children have brought so much love, laughter, and joy into my life; I honestly cannot imagine a life without them. After much reflection and prayer, I am ready to begin my own journey into motherhood. Even though I am currently single and will have sole responsibility for this child, in no way would I be raising this child alone. My entire family and network of friends are just as excited to welcome this little one into our world.\n \nI am a professional woman, who actually enjoys working and has been blessed with career success. Because I intend to keep working, I have sought the advice and counsel of other professional women who are currently raising kids (or already have done so). With the help of these women, I am developing a list of resources and strategies that I can use, when the time comes. But more importantly, I already have a support system of women who are doing the same thing – juggling work and family – and doing it all quite successfully.\n \nIn addition to working and spending quality time with my family, I have several hobbies that you’ll learn more about as you read. All in all, I think people will say that I am full of love, lots of fun, and overflowing with energy and enthusiasm for life and living! \n', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'About Me', 5498, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1365622456, 0),

It is exceedingly difficult to supervise a class of Freshmen when a gorgeous girl walks into the class, and calls you out. So, here I am, put up or shut up time. I put up, and took her on our first date,,,To meet my entire family.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Did I mention that Amanda can be extremely patient, as well? Again, lucky for us, this was one of those times. I don''t know what I was thinking, but I subjected her to my mom, dad, brother, sister, their spouses, my aunts, uncles, cousins, and THEIR spouses. Don''t get me wrong, my family is great, but that''s a lot for anyone to take. We also narrowly avoided getting sucked up by a tornado on the way home. First date, no kidding, and she stayed. I met Amanda''s family a month, or so, later. Her dad just wanted to be sure that my intentions were honorable. Something about owning a lot of land, a front loader, and no one missing me...but that is neither here nor there. A couple of years later, we were married in Amanda’s hometown. It must be providence.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Fast forward 10+ years. We have found a great city in which to live, and work. We created successful and truly rewarding careers in product design (more on this in another section). We adopted three wonderful cats, bought and remodeled our first home, and traveled all over the world. We also bought our next house, enjoy golfing, picked up fishing, and archery (more on that later, too).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is safe to say that we have happy and fulfilling lives, but we have always known that something is missing. We wanted to share all of it with kids. We tried to do just that for years, but one miscarriage led to another and another and, well, you get the picture. The specialists were called in, tears were shed, deep seeded beliefs were questioned, and something was made very clear. We still want a family, but it isn''t going to happen that way. We are both excited to welcome an adopted child into our home to love, cherish, teach, and maybe spoil a bit.

(1332, 'In 2002, against both of our better judgment, we agreed to meet on a blind date, encouraged by the middle school students and their parents who Lori was teaching at the time and Sam was coaching.  By the next day we were in a serious relationship and within two weeks we were planning a trip back to England for Christmas to meet Sam''s family.  Sam had forewarned them he was bringing home the girl he was going to marry.  Although Lori agreed within a few short months that an engagement was imminent, she made Sam swear he would not ask her until at least a year of dating.\n After nine or ten months, Lori started to complain about a lack of a ring!  Sam ( a British Citizen) had to renew his work visa, given his plan to return back to the UK had changed so dramatically!  After a Jewish based ceremony at the Philadelphia Cricket Club in August of 2004 we enjoyed a honeymoon in Jamaica, followed by a trip to England to repeat our vows at a Christian based service in front of our UK family and friends, plus a few travelers from the USA.\nWhile the instant attraction from that first date has not dwindled in the slightest, it has given way to a deeper understanding that without each other, neither of us are complete.\n\nHaving spent a large part of our professional lives working with children, we were both ready to start growing our family shortly after we were married and presumed the process would be straight forward and immediate.  However, after several months of trying to conceive without success, we sought fertility treatment.  After a great deal of expense physically, financially and most noticeably of all, emotionally, we took a break from treatment having been told we were in the 1% of infertile couples that are classified as "unexplained."  During that break from treatment we conceived naturally and have since devoted our lives to the miracle that is now our four-year-old daughter.  A few years ago we started to try to conceive a sibling for Ellarose but ran into the same issues we faced the first time around.  This time we only endured about 9 months of treatment, assessments and surgeries in an attempt to have another child.  Although we do not feel quite the same grief and devastation we felt the first time, the three of us still feel our family is not yet complete.  \nAfter many discussions as to the appropriateness of adoption for our family, aided by Lori''s unique understanding of the subject, having been adopted herself and having a special, unique relationship with her birthmother, we are in complete agreement that not only is it something we feel is right for us, we feel it is the very reason why we have the "unexplained infertility" issue in the first place.   We truly believe we are well prepared and destined to become adoptive parents to a child and we are able to offer them a comfortable and loving home and more importantly, a close and loving family.  That "unexplained" part of our diagnosis is no longer a mystery to us; it is easily explained, as it has led us down this path.\n\nWe love to take family trips as often as possible, visiting friends and family in Toronto and of course England, where Ellarose gets excited to see her cousins and Grandparents and the rest of the very tight extended family.\nIn the fall and winter we take trips to the mountains to snow tube and ski and we love to take trips to Disney World. In the spring and summer we like to go to the beach with our friends and family, although most of the time is spent doing anything but lying in the sun! \nFor all those days we can’t spend on vacation, we are fortunate enough to live in a beautiful home that has a huge yard, surrounded by trees, which becomes the perfect setting to play, have cookouts, explore and relax. During the winter, we have plenty of space indoors to play or to unwind watching a movie together.\nOur whole family is very active. Lori and Sam still play soccer regularly and Sam does a lot of coaching.\nEllarose loves to play outside or go to her swim, dance or soccer lessons. However, her Grandma was thrilled last year when she to appeared on stage next to her in a musical!\nThank you for your the time you have taken to read this brief account of how we have started to become a family. We have so much love to give another child and the three of us can''t wait for our family to grow again.', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'A Little More About Us', 5699, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1368668315, 0);

My parents were our biggest fans and provided all of the love, security, and encouragement a child could want.<p>\n<BR />\n<p>Jon and I met through a mutual friend in college.   I was attracted to Jon’s witty sense of humor, his loyalty, his work ethic, and his love for Jesus.  I knew he was the one I wanted to spend the rest of my life with and raise children with.  We’ve been happily married for 16 years.</p>\n<BR/ >\n<p>We were blessed 5 years ago when we adopted our son, Sam.  He is the love of my life – like my heart walking around outside of my body :) . He just started Kindergarten and loves it!</p>\n<BR />\n<p>I am an accountant and have been with the same accounting firm for more than 15 years.  I work part time so I can be home with Sam after school.  I love to travel and we try to take a trip each year.  I also enjoy reading (when I can find the time), piddling in the yard, and decorating our home, especially for the holidays!</p>\n<BR/ >\n<p>Sam was an answer to many prayers.  And, as much as we have enjoyed every minute, I have always felt our family was somehow incomplete.  I think it is so important for Sam to have a brother or sister to love and grow up with and for that little brother or sister to have a big brother!

Katie was born with a hip condition which would make it difficult for her to carry a child, so adoption was always something discussed as part of building our family. For the past 2 years we have undergone intense fertility treatments and the whole pregnancy thing is just not working for us. Because adoption was always something we wanted to do we decided what better time than now.

Because I grew up in a major city in the Northeast, where there was considerable ethnic and racial diversity, my friends in childhood were primarily African American and Latina.  Today, although I live in a small town in the South, I''m thrilled that the large university attracts a diverse population of people.   Therefore, I continue to enjoy a diverse social circle.\n\nI am very actively engaged in my church community:  The Unitarian Universalist Congregation.

We have a vibrant and thriving church community, with over 200 members and many families with small children. The Sunday School program is very popular and the kids love it!  UUC Sunday School teaches children about all major world religions and instills in them progressive values, such as:  respect for the inherent worth and dignity of all people, good stewardship of the earth, and the importance of active citizenship in community.\n\n \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my letter.

(1392, '       We both work full time, but our plan for childcare is to avoid daycare centers.  Eli plans to take a 3-month maternity leave and then hopes to return to work on a part-time basis.  We hope to offset our days off such that either of us is home with our child nearly every day of the week.  Eli’s boss is very supportive of our plans to adopt and will be flexible with her schedule.  For any days that we both may need to work, Conrad’s sister, Katrina, lives in town as a stay-at-home mom and has offered her assistance.  We spend a lot of time with Katrina and her family; it is a weekly tradition for us to gather together for brunch after Mass on Sunday mornings.  \n       We like to have a Bar-B-Q, or we''ll take a trip to the zoo, or go for a hike.  One day, we went hiking on a trail near Katrina’s home that leads to a small reservoir where our dogs are welcome to swim.  The only thing that Jackson enjoys more than chasing squirrels is swimming.  As you can see, our families have some good times together and we look forward to our children playing together and developing close friendships.\n       Occasionally, we have the opportunity to get out of town.  As a veterinarian, Eli sometimes is able to travel to continuing education conferences and we will take the opportunity to turn these trips into little vacations.  By far, our favorite place to go when we get out of town, is to take a long weekend and drive into the mountains where Eli’s family has an old cabin on some property along the Colorado River.  The cabin has been in Eli’s family for many years, her grandfather bought it when her mom was a young child and, as a result, she has many happy memories of going there when she was younger.  The mountain air is so fresh and clean and at night, the sky is so clear that you can see thousands more stars than you can see in town; it’s so relaxing and refreshing to spend the weekend away from the business of town.

Jackson is really good with children, our little 3-year-old nephew can crawl all over him or take toys right out of his mouth, and he has never uttered a single complaint.

Above everything else, Briggs loves to eat and his favorite treat is green beans.  Whenever we put a pot of green beans on the stove to boil, Briggs comes running and starts begging at us until they are done.  Eli has taught him to sit up like a dog before he gets his treat.

(1400, 'Growing up in Goodland, KS was a wonderful experience as a child.  Goodland is a small town in western Kansas with a population of about four thousand people.   I was the youngest child in my family, and I had an older sister and brother.  My father, Dale, worked as an appliance repair technician, and later he owned his own repair business.  My mother, Linda, worked several jobs as an administrative assistant for the schools, and later she became and still works as the Sherman County Clerk.  I have one sister, Shawna, who is six years older, and one brother, Jeremy, who is two years older.  As a child, living in a small town provided a safe environment to grow and learn.  I had great teachers who fostered my interests in science and math.  I have many friendships that started in grade school and continue to this day.  In high school I was active in many academic groups, and I also was a long distance runner in cross country and track.  \nMy family, growing up, was loving, supportive, and had a strong sense of togetherness.  My dad exemplified what it means to work hard every day.  He instilled in us kids a strong work ethic and a commitment to family.  My mother instilled a great many qualities, one of these being to never give up and never stop trying.  She was always very supportive of my activities, whether it was academic, sports, or choir.  I also grew up close to both of my grandmothers, and enjoyed spending time with both of them. \nOur family is still very close, and even though we are spread out over Kansas and Colorado, and don’t get together as often as I would like, we have a great time when we do.  My family plans a vacation every year, and in the past few years we’ve been to Mexico, the Rockies, Branson, and several lakes in Kansas.  We always have a lot of laughs when we get together.  \nOn my side of the family, my sister and her husband, Tony, have three wonderful girls, Mackenzie, Emily, and Addison.  My brother and his wife, Katie, have two boys, Reid and Nate, and one girl, Bree.  They are all very sweet, caring, and fun kids. \nMichelle and I were introduced by a mutual friend in 2003, and we right away hit it off.  We shared common interests growing up, in music, and in humor. I found her to be very pretty with beautiful blue eyes and a great laugh. I was also drawn to her intelligence and her fun personality.  We continued to date several years before being engaged in September, 2005, and being married on April 29th, 2006.  I value Michelle as a caregiver, and her unconditional love and support.  She is thoughtful and considerate of others. It’s these qualities that will make her a great mother.  We share a love of camping, boating, and I’ve even gotten her to enjoy fishing, even when she has to bait her own hook!\nAlthough we do not have children, we do love our dog as if she was one.  Our dog Mia has been a part of our family for almost 10 years, and she is a very kind and loveable golden retriever.  She loves more than anything to spend time outside with us, and can seemingly play fetch for hours.\nI would describe my personality as a reserved, rational, independent, and adventurous spirit.  I easily make friends and am very loyal, trusting, and generous to those close to me.  I am somewhat of an introvert, and enjoy time alone to think and make decisions.  I believe this helps me be a good listener and a patient teacher.  I have always had a drive to figure out how things work, and I enjoy working on projects that require logical analysis.  I believe people should be treated with fairness and equity.  I am an action oriented person. I like to be up doing things.  I also enjoy adventurous activities like boating and wakeboarding.  I like the opportunity to work in my garage, where I have developed a hobby of woodworking and carpentry.  Over the years, I have accumulated enough tools to complete a variety of different projects.  Overall, I am an optimistic, cheerful, trusting individual.  I believe that I possess good qualities to teach and instill strong values as a parent.\nSpiritually, I am of a Catholic Christian background.  However, I was taught to be accepting and sympathetic to those of other faiths and spiritual backgrounds.  My faith has given me a strong commitment to helping others, and treating others as I would like to be treated.\nUpon graduating pharmacy school in 2002, I have worked as a pharmacist in Manhattan, KS.  I have worked as a hospital pharmacist the last 9 years.  I find my work very fulfilling.  Every day I make an impact by helping patients, nurses, and physicians.  In my job, I review medication orders from physicians, and ensure the safe and effective delivery of these medications to our patients.  I also answer drug related questions from patients and other health care professionals. The part of my job that I enjoy the most is programming our pharmacy system software to prevent drug related errors from reaching our patients.  Another satisfying aspect of my job is the camaraderie that exists in the pharmacy.  We are a tight knitted crew that work really well together, and also have fun outside of work.\nInfertility, unfortunately, has been a dark cloud over our marriage the last 5 years.  Our doctors have told us that we have what is called unexplained infertility, although there could be some issues with the quality of Michelle’s eggs.  Regardless, it has been a challenge, and a process of grieving the fact we cannot conceive our own child.  We still yearn to be parents, because we feel that there is lot of love for us to give a child, even if it is not our own biological child.\nIf we are blessed to become adoptive parents, I feel that I could provide a loving and safe environment for the child.  I will be a good listener, and be a patient father.  Michelle and I also have decided that in order for the child to grow up healthy, that we would maintain any level of openness necessary for that to happen.  \nThanks for reading and God Bless!\n', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'About Wes', 5705, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1372202306, 0);

(1404, 'Dear Birth Parent(s)\nWe are Whitney and Tyler and we are honored that you have considered us to be adoptive parents! After two years of the pain and heartbreak of infertility, we have turned to adoption, and this seems to be the path we should have take all along. Adoption has been and exciting and very positive situation for us so far. We hope to find a birthmom or family that we can remain close friends with over the years and watch their child grow together. \n\nWe''ve had a hard time writing birth parent letters because we hate the thought of "selling ourselves" to you. We want you to choose us because you feel we are the right match for you and your baby, not by something we''ve said! So we will simply tell you the highlights of our life and we''ve included some FAQ''s that we''ve answered on agency applications. We hope to hear from you soon! \n\nDescribe yourselves: Tyler and I are high school sweethearts. We''ve been together for over 8 years, and married for 3. We finished high school and college before getting married. Whitney is a first grade teacher, and Tyler is a sales representative for chain stores such as rite aid, walgreens, etc. We both have excellent family hours, weekends off, and Whitney has summers off. \n\nWhat is your marriage like?  We have been best friends for years. We spend the majority of our time laughing, wrestling and being silly. We talk and text frequently throughout the day and are basically inseparable.  Two years of infertility has really brought us closer as we have persevered through so much stuff! \n\nDescribe your home: We have  lived in our home for 4 years, but have lived in this city since we children. Our house is small but cozy. 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, fenced backyard, neighbors with small children, excellent school district, very safe neighborhood. We are close to parks and public pools.  \n\nWhat do you do together: We love to travel and try to take a vacation every year. We love to watch movies and curl up on the couch together. A typical evening includes grilling out on the back patio and playing with our dogs or taking a walk. \n\nHow do you handle your disagreements?  \nThese are usually rare and quick. We say what needs to be said and move on. We learned very early on in our relationship that cold shoulders and hinting around problems just drove both of us nuts. If we''re mad we say it and why, and we move on. We are usually laughing again after ten minutes. \n\nHow do you manage your money?  \nWe have done a good job with our money after seeing many others our age jump into a lot of debt. We have no credit cards whatsoever. If we want to do something expensive, we save. We have our own version of "Dave Ramsey cash flow" system that seems to work for us. We have no student loans or debt besides our mortgage. We do not have car payments, and we are paying for my grad school one semester at a time with cash.  We do plan to take a loan to pay for adoption. Seeing as we are in good shape otherwise, we know we can afford one payment. \n\nWhat do other members of your family think about your decision to adopt? \nOur families are 100% supportive. They have watched us struggle to add a child to our family and they have been so wonderful throughout every step. We have already had one baby shower, and the entire family helped us with an adoption yard sale in the spring. I can''t wait to introduce a little one to them! It will be quite the amazing homecoming when the time comes. We have  a large family with many brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles and cousins who will be spoiling this little one rotten! \n\nWhat are your attitudes and values on child rearing? \nWe are both very fun loving and want to raise happy and healthy children.  We also tend to be strict and we want to raise very respectful children who are disciplined. We agree that we want our family to be active and spend more time outdoors than in. We want our child to attend church and have the support system of the church. We want our family to be a priority and we plan to build in time just for us and protect it. \n\nHow would you discipline a child?  \nSeeing as we are a teacher/ coach, we are very good at discipline. We plan to use time-out/ redirection with young children until they are able to reason. After that point, discipline needs to be an opportunity to teach appropriate behaviors. We believe you need to discuss with the child what they did, why it was wrong, and how to act in the future. We do not believe in physical punishments, but we will remove privileges as necessary.  It is important to us to also model Godly behavior and good values to our children so they may learn by example. \n \nDo you plan to raise your child with religious training and values?  \nYes, we want our child to have a good moral compass and as sense of right and wrong. We don''t plan to force religion on any child, but we want to expose them to our faith and make sure they are familiar with the Bible so they may make informed decisions about their faith when the time comes. Being raised in the church helped us so much as far as being on the right path and making smart decisions, so we want this for our child as much as possible.  \n\nWhat are your values about education?  \nComing from a teacher''s perspective :) Education is obviously very important to us. We plan to be very involved in school and make sure our child makes it a priority in their life. I don''t want to pressure them too much seeing as I was a very anxious child when it came to school, but we want them to know that it is important and graduation/ attending college or a trade school is mandatory. It is becoming near impossibly to make a living without a degree in this age and we want to make sure they are prepared. \n\nDo the schools in your area have a good academic reputation – are you planning to have your child in public, private or home school? \nThe schools in our area are excellent. We plan for our child to attend public school. Seeing as I am a teacher, I will have the option to send our child to our districted school or take them to the school where I am teaching. That will all depend on where I am at the time, but regardless we have a definite advantage when it comes to the quality of education. \n\nWill you tell your child about adoption?     If yes, when?  \nYes, I plan to always tell my child about adoption. I have a couple pictures books already. I want them to know how they came to me and what a miracle it all was. I want them to know that they were so loved that two mommies are part of their life. I will always be honest to my child and answer their questions in age appropriate ways. I think secrecy would only lead to a damaged relationship later on. \n\nWhat do envision the future relationship between you and the birth family?\nWe would love to share letters and pictures frequently. We want the birth family to know their child is happy and safe and loved. Visits would be a possibility if we are close enough. \n', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'Birth Parent Letter', 5157, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1372640117, 0),
(1405, 'Dear Birth Parent(s)\nWe are Whitney and Tyler and we are honored that you have considered us to be adoptive parents! After two years of the pain and heartbreak of infertility, we have turned to adoption, and this seems to be the path we should have take all along. Adoption has been and exciting and very positive situation for us so far. We hope to find a birthmom or family that we can remain close friends with over the years and watch their child grow together. \n\nWe''ve had a hard time writing birth parent letters because we hate the thought of "selling ourselves" to you.

So we will simply tell you the highlights of our life and we''ve included some FAQ''s that we''ve answered on agency applications.

We finished high school and college before getting married. Whitney is a first grade teacher, and Tyler is a sales representative for chain stores such as rite aid, walgreens, etc. We both have excellent family hours, weekends off, and Whitney has summers off. \n\nWhat is your marriage like?  We have been best friends for years. We spend the majority of our time laughing, wrestling and being silly. We talk and text frequently throughout the day and are basically inseparable.  Two years of infertility has really brought us closer as we have persevered through so much stuff! \n\nDescribe your home: We have  lived in our home for 4 years, but have lived in this city since we children.

(1416, 'Matt and I began dating at the age of 15.  We were married on September 6, 2003.  Because we were high school sweethearts, we have literally grown up together.   \n\nGreen has been a part of Matt''s employment since he graduated from Garden City Community College Technical  Program. He worked for John Deere as a technician for twelve years before starting at his job at Kansas City Power and Light.  He works as a Technician on the windmills that provide electricity using wind energy.  Green Energy has gone from just a word to being a big part of our lives.  \n\nI have worked in a Government Agency for 14 years. This tenure has given me seniority which allows for a flexible schedule.  I am able to attend school functions and be a bigger part of my families’ life. I also used this scheduling to help my grandma when she was in the rest home and needed an advocate. \n\nWe purchased our country home in 2003.  We have worked as a family to remodel our home room by room. We have two floors complete. Our next project is to remodel the basement to make a play room, a second family room, and an extra guest room.    \n\nWe are very close to both our families.  We look forward to spending time with them.  Our house is often bustling with children playing, or having sleepovers with our girls. Children, whether it is cousins or friends, are always welcome in our home.    \n\nWe encourage our girls to try new things. Kristen is participating in gymnastics this summer. Both girls are also taking swimming lessons, in the summer reading program, and are participating in the Summer children''s Program at the Park.  \n\nOur family loves to do things together.  It is great to be able to watch the girls learn and grow.  Some of our family hobbies we enjoy doing as a family are riding four-wheelers, taking the camper and the boat to the lake for the weekend, playing games, attending family functions, and in the winter we like to take a couple of weekends and go to a motel, so the girls can swim and find indoor fun.  \n\nIn addition to our jobs, we operate a small farm and a cattle operation.  The girls have already started building their own cattle herd.  Each year when their cow’s calf is sold, the profits go into their savings account to help them later in life.  They are very excited to be a part of watching the baby calves grow, and then in the fall getting to see their bank accounts grow too.  \n\nIn our opinion, having good times and making memories with our children is the key to building a great and strong family relationship.  We want an honest and open relationship with our children.  We feel that the more we do as a family together builds the foundation for an open line of communication.  We want our children to be confident we will support them through the tough times as well as the good times.   \n\nMatt and I have been blessed with two beautiful girls.  Due to health issues, we are unable to have additional children.  We want nothing more in this world than to complete our family through open \n\nadoption.  We are great parents to our daughters, but we feel we have so much more love to give.  Hopefully as you read this, you too will feel that we would be good parents for your baby. \n', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'OUR STORY', 5904, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1374382073, 0),

(1429, '<p>            Tylor and I met through a mutual friend in the fall of 2003. We remained acquaintances for about a year and started dating each other in November of 2004. Shortly thereafter, we learned we were pregnant with our first daughter. In March of 2005 Tylor asked me to marry him and I said YES! Ultimately we chose to wait to get married until we had known each other longer and knew each other a little better. We were adamant about not getting married simply because we were having a child together, but because we loved each other and wanted to be together. As we went through the pregnancy, Tylor was constantly by my side; attending every doctor’s visit and helping me in any way he could. He was truly amazing and incredibly supportive throughout my difficult pregnancy with our oldest daughter Cadence, whom we now lovingly call Cady. She was born on September 5<sup>th</sup>, 2005. We chose to be married on March 17th, 2007, St. Patrick''s Day, a humorous gesture relating to my Irish heritage. We decided on a small wedding with just close family and friends. We were wed on a gorgeous spring day in Sedgwick County Park and Cady was our flower girl.</p>\n<p>            Since, then, we have welcomed another beautiful daughter to our family. Dallys was born October 12<sup>th</sup>, 2009 following another very rough pregnancy which, unfortunately, has left me unable to have more children of our own. Our daughters bring tremendous joy and purpose to our lives. We always knew we wanted to have a family and being parents is the most rewarding and important job we’ll ever have. However, Tylor and I truly believe that our family is not yet complete. There isn''t a day that goes by in which we don''t thank God for the wonderful blessings he has given us in Cady and Dallys, but we do feel as though there is a piece of the puzzle missing. We feel that bringing a little boy into our home would complete our family and giving our daughters a baby brother would be a delight beyond words. Adoption has always been in our hearts even before our inability to conceive and we are truly are grateful to have this option. We pray only that we may be blessed with the opportunity of loving another child through it. Together, we share a very special history and our commitment to each other runs deep. We have learned that we can handle anything life throws at us as long as we keep a positive attitude and keep in mind that God is always on our side.</p>', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'Our Lives Together ', 5956, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'text', 1392248709, 0),

Summer days were spent riding bikes, jumping ropes and swimming in pools.  Fond winter memories are of sled riding, making snowmen and drinking hot chocolate on snowy days.  Jus was given the choice of pursuing any sport or activity that interested her.  When Jus was interested in softball, Christine pitched the ball endlessly in the backyard.  When it was lacrosse, two sticks were bought so we could throw the ball back and fourth.  Girl Scouts, swim team, saxophone lessons, dance classes and gymnastics were some of the choices that were pursued.   \n\nWe loved watching Jus learn how to crawl and speak her first word.  Time was dedicated to raising a strong, confident and healthy daughter.  We found the greatest joy in watching our daughter become an adult.  Jon came into parenting when Jussi was a teenager.  He took on the challenge with his whole heart and became a wonderful father.  The three of us are ready for a baby to join our happy lives.  Jussi will be the best big sister.

We have known each other since we were both 11 years old as we both grew up in neighboring towns in Central New York.  Our time together as children, leading up to our engagement was wonderful.  We were the best of friends and our families were close then.  We knew that we were meant to be together and our love and respect for each other grew each and every day.  In 1995, shortly after Jim entered the Navy, we got married.  We are not only husband and wife, we are best friends.  We have three boys; James (16), Tanner (12) and Bryce (9) and they are extremely excited about having a baby sister.

They are wonderful boys that are so caring and always have smiles on their faces.  They are all doing well academically and are very athletic.  When asked to do something, like chores, they do so without hesitation.  We will raise our daughter the same way and give her the resources that she needs to accomplish all the dreams that she has, as well.\n\n\nJim attended Brockport College and Kim attended Herkimer County Community College.  Jim has been in the Navy for over 18 years and Kim is a stay at home mother.  Jim enjoys playing golf, is active in the boys’ schools and sports, and volunteering in the local community.  Kim also enjoys sports, where she was a bowler in college, is active in the boys’ schools and sports, and enjoys reading.  We both enjoy spending time with family and friends.  We love to spend quality time together as a family.  We enjoy things such as family movie nights, going camping, playing in the yard and park with the boys, and roasting marshmallows during a summer night. We also love to travel, whether it is to a museum, a sporting event, trips to see family, or to Disney World we enjoy that time together.  \n\n \nWhile Jim has been in the Navy, we have lived all over the East Coast, as well as London, England.  We have now settled into our “forever home,” as Jim will be retiring from the Navy in 2016.  Our home is a 5 bedroom, 3 baths; split foyer home in Maryland with one acre of land, spacious front and side yards and a large fenced in back yard.  It also has an in-ground pool.  Our neighborhood has a community park with sports fields and is three blocks away from a river with a dock.  The elementary, middle, and high schools are all within a three mile range.  We live in a wonderful, quite neighborhood where kids, of all ages, play together and all the neighbors treat each other like family.  We have two dogs; a chow named Valley and a Llapsa named Chloe.  We also have a cat named C.C.  All our pets are well mannered and absolutely love children.\n\n\nWe are both very close to our families.

(1468, 'I was born in New York as the first grandchild on both sides of my family.  It was a little lonely at first but now I have two loving brothers, the cutest nephew and lots of cousins with children of their own to share with your child. \n\nMy Mom is a nurse and the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.  She taught me about caring for people, giving back to the community and an appreciation for healthy living and life in general. I have been a physician assistant for over 12 years and enjoy taking care of my patients and always look for ways to improve my community by volunteering. My mom also started a weekly tradition of taking us to the bookstore to chose a book to read for the week.  My love for reading has only grown since then and I look forward to taking your child to the bookstore every weekend for their new book.\n \nMy parents divorced when I was 25 years old and lucky for me, my mom remarried 5 years later to a wonderful man, Stan.  \n\nMy Dad is a retired salesman who was my biggest sideline fan as a child. There wasn''t a softball game, track meet or swim meet that he missed. I think he even enjoyed taking me to Girl Scouts.  I look forward to being your child’s biggest sideline fan in whatever activities they choose. “Pops” is a proud Grandpa and looks forward to another grandchild to love and spoil.\n\nMy “Little” Brothers, Kevin and Kyle are 6 and 8 years younger than me respectively.  During our childhood I was the built in babysitter and looked forward to helping Mom and Dad play Santa at Christmas.  I already have a lot of experience assembling He-Man castles, Matchbox Car tracks and Big Wheels.  As adults we are very close friends and have many things in common such as a love for sports, music and the outdoors.\n\nWhile my parents were at work, I was lucky to spend time with my grandparents and after having the opportunity to live in Germany for over 8 years total as an adult, I now appreciate all the German baking and cooking they tried to teach me. I never realized it was German until living there and understand the importance of preserving my child’s culture and heritage as their life story. I also look forward to passing on the traditions and cultures I have and may even be able to teach your child a little German. Ich spreche ein bisschen Deutsch! (I speak a little German). \n\nWhen I was 8 my family moved to Florida.  There we enjoyed many water activities such as swimming, fishing, boating and later scuba diving.  I participated in competitive swimming as a child through high school and now in adulthood enjoy competing in triathlons. I also volunteer at the local pool with swimming safety classes and look forward to teaching your child to swim like a fish. \n\nAnother love we share as a family is baseball and we look forward to March in Florida and spring training baseball.  Go Braves and Rays! \n\nBoth of my parents instilled in us the desire for learning.  I graduated from the University of Florida with my bachelor’s degree and later from the University of Nebraska with my graduate degree.

Derek proposed in June 2006, and we were married in December 2006, in Santa Fe, New Mexico (where we were living for one year for Derek''s job).  Our wedding was very small, but we had a fabulous time celebrating with our family and close friends.  Before the wedding, Holly made a wish that we would have a white wedding.  She got her wish, as Mother Nature delivered in the form of 36 inches of snow!\n\n\nWe moved back to Kansas City in 2007 and started working at law firms.  The next year we decided to start a family.  After several years of not being able to conceive, we transitioned to adoption.  In October 2011, we got a phone call from a social worker about a young couple that was expecting a baby in January 2012.  This couple had seen our profile and was considering us as potential adoptive parents.  We were extremely excited.  We met with the couple the next week and, a few days later, learned that they had selected us as adoptive parents.  The social worker called us on Holly''s birthday with the news.  Over the next few months, we spent time with the young couple and got to know them and their families.  Then, in January 2012, we all headed to the hospital and Kolbe Sage was born.  He was immediately loved by everyone present.  His adoption was finalized in March 2012.  And we continue to see his birthparents on a regular basis.

As a parent I will strive to be like these people who may not of approved of what I was telling them, but they did not condemn it either. Love should be unconditional.  \n\nFrom the moment I knew how to read, and for as long as I can remember, I was a fan of Superman. It was always cooler to like Batman or Spider-Man or the Wolverine, but Superman was my guy. He''s the one that stood for hope and caring. Superman saves people. More than anything else I believe this has had the greatest effect on my world view. It means that I believe that good people will always win out in the end! Even if it takes a very long time, and there is a struggle to get there!\n\nFew things that are worth having come easily or without sacrifice. For a long time I resisted the idea of adoption. I didn''t feel like there was enough acceptance in the world for two men to adopt a child. With the recent repeal of Don''t Ask Don''t Tell and of the  Defense of Marriage Act, as well as the several states that have legalized same-sex marriage, I was made hopeful.  It means that love and kindness trump hatred and brutality.\n\nNow I believe that in the very near future people will be wondering why gay marriage was ever controversial in the first place.\n\nLearn more about Chris and Jay at<a href="http://jayandchristopher.com"> jayandchristopher.com</a>', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'About Jay', 6248, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1388457016, 0),

At some family gatherings, they play a duet for everyone to enjoy. David''s family is very sports oriented - growing up, David remembers playing baseball, basketball, football and going golfing with his father and brother.

While dating, Wes often played this song for me (the Garth Brooks version as he is a big Garth fan!) and the sung this song to me as part of his proposal. It was an easy selection to pick this as our first dance at our Wedding.\n<BR><BR><B>\n"I''ll Follow You"</B> - Once we were settled as a couple, we tried to have our own child, but were soon confronted with infertility issues. I found out that I was allergic to Progesterone, a hormone needed to support a baby while developing in the womb. Although this diagnosis was difficult for me to learn of, Wes was by my side the entire time, guiding me through the deep and keeping me close to him.\n<BR><BR><B>\n"Counting Stars"</B> - As a couple we explored ways to conceive a child biologically and quickly found we would be putting my life and the child''s at risk. Surrogacy was an expensive option and we were uncomfortable with some of the ethical choices that might come with treatments.\n<BR><BR><B>\n"Let Her Go"</B> - This song touches my heart. It''s my melody of letting go of my biological child. Sometimes we don''t know how much we love, want, or will miss something until it was taken away from us. Especially when its gone suddenly, without warning, and we have no control over it.\n<BR><BR><B>\n"Compass"</B> - After exploring our biological options to have a child, my husband and I became excited about the idea of adopting. The more we listened to our hearts we knew it was the path we were suppose to take.\n<BR><BR><B>\n"Love Alone is Worth the Fight"</B> - As we have worked through our infertility and the application for adoption, we know its all worth it, because one day we will be able to share our love with you, the birth parents, and an extraordinary child.', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'Gwen&#039;s Adoption Playlist', 6570, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1394320355, 0),

(1534, 'Hi! I want to share with you two types of info: characteristics of myself and a biography of me. Sound exciting enough yet?? Let’s get started!!\n<BR><BR><BR>\n<p style="font-weight:bold;">\nGwen’s Characteristics</p>\n<BR>\nSharing some of my strongest character traits is important to me, because I figure a child in my home will certainly be exposed to these things! So this section is dedicated to my morals, interest, and values - in no particular order.\n<BR><BR>\nI LOVE animals! We have a dog, Pete (Corgi mix), and he is about to get a little sister (Blue Heeler). We would have more pets, but Wes keeps me in check. I think growing up on a farm sparked my love and compassion for animals from a young age. My family taught me to respect and care for all living creatures and I hold this value close to my heart for all creatures big and small.  \n<BR><BR>\nEmpathy for others is important. This helps to build a kind and caring world. If we can place ourselves in others’ shoes , I believe it’s the first step to caring for others. All of these things are important characteristics I hope to instill in a child: care for others, compassion, and empathy. Somehow my mother, with the help of my extended family, raised me with a strong value for these things. I pray I can pass these onto a child as well.\n<BR><BR>\nLiving an active life within the Church has built my spirituality and given me peace. We will as families (both immediate and extended)  enjoy spiritual activities together. My faith has given me strength, peace, and hope in the most difficult times in my life.\n<BR><BR>\nFootball!! I am a HUGE football fan. The best time of the year is NFL season and I go a little nuts following the New England Patriots. We recently had a new Professional Indoor Football team move to Dodge City, so now I also have the Law to root for too!\n<BR><BR>\nI strongly value education. I want to teach strong critical thinking skills to our little one so they can think for themselves and form their own educated opinions. Since I went to school for science, I imagine I will pass some of that on to a little one, but I think I will incorporate general  learning activities into daily living.\n<BR><BR><BR><p style="font-weight:bold;">\nGwen’s Biography</p>\n<BR>\nI was raised on a farm by an extremely loving, unbelievably hardworking, single mother. I have one older brother who I look up to a love very much. He gives me great advice, is full of wisdom, and one of the hardest working people I know. I grew up in northeast Kansas outside of a very small town (think less than 400 people). I went to school for biological psychology and spent two years in graduate school studying neuroscience.\n<BR><BR>\nI met my husband, Wes, while in college. Two years after meeting, we married in my hometown (with a blue bouquet!) and started our happy ever after. We moved to the east coast so I could attend graduate school in Bethesda, Maryland. After two years we moved to Key West, Florida were Wes began his career within the National Weather Service. We both missed the Kansas life and our families, so we were thrilled when he was offered a position in Dodge City. We moved here in 2011 and have been happy in our home ever since.\n<BR><BR>\nI have a close extended family. We will usually get together for holidays and anniversaries and I always look forward to my grandmas cooking! As I mentioned in the beginning, my immediate family includes my mom and brother. My parents separated and then divorced with I was in junior high. It was odd for me to marry Wes, because I couldn’t imagine forever. But I have been shocked at how much our love has grown for each other every year. Now I can’t imagine anything except forever.\n', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'About Gwen', 6570, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1395445700, 0),

We are open to a relationship that is comfortable for you and look forward to getting to know more about you.\nFrank & Bridget Skaggs \nABOUT US \nWe were introduced by a mutual friend more than twelve years ago and have been enjoying the adventure ever since. The double rainbow on our wedding day was an amazing start to our wonderful life together. We are an easygoing, loving couple who both feel fortunate enough to have married our best friend. We always have fun together and frequently find ourselves laughing or just being silly, by making crazy faces at each other or singing made up songs. Our little dog Rocky also loves to sing along! We’ve always dreamt about building our family and are excited to start singing some kids songs too.\nOUR INTERESTS\nIn our free time we love to travel and sightsee, whether it’s out of state, another country, or a day/weekend getaway. Our travels abroad tend to draw us to the Caribbean, as we love the ocean, outdoor activities, and the carefree atmosphere. We look forward to exposing our child to different cultures and experiences, both through our travels and within our local community. \nWe enjoy camping with friends, many of whom have young children, and we can’t wait to help our child toast his/her first marshmallow. We love going to San Francisco Giants baseball games and often spend the weekend in the city so we can sightsee as well. Winter months draw us to the Sierra Mountains where we can play in the snow and go sledding. We look forward to make our first snowman as a family. Although we love the outdoors, we also find a peacefulness cuddling on the couch, watching a movie with a bowl of popcorn — made on the stovetop, of course! \nOUR HOME\nWe live in a well-established, kid friendly neighborhood in Sacramento, California, where we consider our neighbors our friends. Walking our dog, Rocky, often turns into social time with him and all the children; he loves the attention and is so gentle. We can’t wait for our child to participate in the annual 4th of July & Halloween block parties. We have enjoyed updating our house over the years, love the home we have created, and are ready to make family memories in it. We look forward to many birthday parties in the backyard, building forts in the living room, and filling the house with the smell of homemade goodies during the holidays.\nOUR FAMILY & FRIENDS \nOur immediate family is scattered across California and Rhode Island, and our visits with them are always cherished. Most of Bridget’s family lives within miles of us and we enjoy seeing them frequently. Our child will be Bridget’s parents’ first grandchild and Grandma Beth will be our day care for the two days a week it’s needed. We are surrounded by a large group of close friends, some of whom we have known since childhood. Many of them have young children we adore, and we are honored to be the godparents of two beautiful girls. We get together with friends and family often and love hosting gatherings at our home, whether it’s for holidays, to barbecue, or just a competitive game of Wii bowling. Our loved ones are almost as eager as we are about our plans for adoption. Their love and support is something we cherish and know we’re blessed to have. \nMY WIFE BRIDGET\nBridget is a caring and nurturing person who inspires me daily. She truly is my best friend. When we went to our first Giants game together and all I could think about was her, I knew that we would be together always. Bridget enjoys camping, crafting, baseball, and cooking. She also enjoys entertaining and creates such a festive environment for any occasion. Our child will know all the wonders of Christmas, as this is her favorite holiday. She will be the most attentive, loving mother; I see it every time she interacts with children. \nBridget is a Registered Nurse and works in the Intensive Care Unit of a nearby hospital. Her part-time schedule will afford her the opportunity to spend many days at home with our child. She’s looking forward to play dates, trips to the zoo/park, and eventually being a classroom helper.\nMY HUSBAND FRANK\nUpon meeting Frank, one may think he’s a serious, tough, macho guy. Truth be told, he is really a big softie and a kid at heart. I can’t wait to see who gets more excitement out of remote control toys, our child or Frank! His playfulness and willingness to try new things are the attributes I love most about him. Frank loves reading, sports, computers, and experimenting with new recipes on the barbecue. He will be an exceptional father, who will provide our child with entertainment, guidance, and unconditional love. I look forward to starting a family with my best friend! \nFrank has worked in the paint industry for over 20 years and is currently a Regional Manager for a nation-wide paint company. He is thankful his job will enable him to be home for family dinner, baths, bedtime stories, and weekend fun. \n OUR PROMISE TO YOU \nWe truly believe a child can never have too many people in their lives that love and support them and we will do everything we can to build a loving, healthy relationship with you. We will provide a home for your child that he/she can flourish in, surrounded with love, guidance, and encouragement. We hope that learning more about us and knowing our commitment to raise a well-rounded, confident child will give you peace of mind. We look forward to getting to know you and sharing this journey with you. \nMuch Love & Respect,\nFrank & Bridget Skaggs\n\n', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'OUR BIRTHMOTHER LETTER', 5748, 3, 'non,memb', 1, 0, 'html', 1396308243, 0),

We long for the day when we can teach a son or daughter about history, nature, technology, reading, music, and how to ride a bicycle.  Chris is eagerly awaiting the days when he can play with cars and trains, Legos, Battleship and other games.  Kim looks forward to curling up on the couch with a cozy blanket on a rainy or snowy day and reading about myths, dragons, dinosaurs and animals.  \n\nChris anticipates teaching a little one about his favorite subjects in school - math and science.  He looks forward to making pizza with our little one, or baking cookies together.  Kim is awaiting the day when she can teach this little one about American history through the American Girl stories.  There will be teddy bear picnics, tea parties fit for a princess, and dress up days with high heels and tiaras.  We plan to have a study/playroom for this little one.  There will be a desk, computer, and various reference books to assist with study needs.  This room will also serve as a place to keep toys and play with them.\n\nWhile we are unable to have a biological child, we will bond with this little one from the first days.  We will immerse him or her in music, language, and reading.   Mozart’s music and other classical music is soothing and enriching for babies.  We will play classical music and move his/her hands to the music.  When it is naptime, we will play soothing music to encourage a peaceful nap.  As a Librarian, Kim loves reading with children.  We will read children’s books all the time to build this little one’s imagination.  We will talk continuously with him/her to encourage speaking.  \n\nKim grew up in a home with her parents and extended family including her grandmother, aunt, and cousin, Adrienne.  It was a wonderful way to grow up, being surrounded by love and guidance from different family members.  Kim and Chris live in a two family home with Kim’s Mom.

(1548, 'Chris and Kim have very different families.  Chris has a very small family consisting of his parents, brother Tim, uncle/aunt/cousin in Connecticut, and an uncle and aunt in California.  He also has a step grandmother in New Jersey and they recently celebrated her 100th birthday.  Kim has a large family consisting of her Mom (sadly her Dad passed away five years ago), brother and his fiancée, and numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins.\n\nHolidays are shared between our families.  Kim and Chris host Mother’s Day and Father’s Day to spend those holidays with both families.  On Mother’s Day, Kim prepares a special dinner and even tries to bake.  The dinner is always fabulous.  The dessert?  Not so much.  Kim loves the spring and brings the season into the celebration.  The table is set with floral table linens and dinnerware, and a spring menu is served.  When we have a little one to share in the celebration, the grandmothers will receive a special gift from him/her.  On Father’s Day, Chris, his Dad, and his brother Tim barbecue a typical hamburgers and hot dogs meal with all of the fixings – ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, beans, and chili.  They enjoy the bonding and time together.\n\nOn St. Patrick’s Day, Kim’s Mom makes the traditional Irish dinner of corned beef and cabbage, and we watch the parade.  Christmas Eve is at Chris’ parents’ home and Christmas Day is at Kim’s Mom’s home.  Kim’s brother David and his fiancée Erin drive down from the Albany area late on Christmas Eve and arrive around 2:30 am on Christmas morning.  They bring their two 75 pound dogs and awaken the entire house when they come charging in.  Kim’s favorite thing to do on New Year’s Day is to watch the Rose Parade.  She looks forward to enjoying the Rose Parade with a little one to marvel at the beautiful floats made solely from plant materials.\n\nThe family events of 2013 were the Christening of Kim’s cousin Lisa and Ed’s baby, Abby, (their fourth child and first daughter) and the Communion of Kim’s cousin Nick and Susan’s daughter, Kaylee.  At Abby’s Christening, there were approximately 25 children under the age of 6.  The children all sat at one table and had placed their orders in advance.  The waiter asked, “Who ordered chicken nuggets?  Who ordered spaghetti and meatballs?”  Each child raised his or her hand for each item.  The highlight was getting to hold Abby for a few minutes.  While Kim held her, she was looking all around and smiling. \n\nAt Kaylee’s Communion, there were about 20 children ranging in age from 6 months to 9 years old.  The children danced and played games with the DJ’s guidance.  Kaylee was the clear winner at hula hooping.  She could even hula-hoop while drinking her soda!  It was beyond entertaining to watch the children and we look forward to the day when our little one will be able to dance and hula-hoop with us.\n\nIn 2014, the family event of the year will be the Christening for our little one.  We can see it all now.  The Pastor will baptize the baby, and introduce him/her to the congregation.  A celebration at our home will follow the service.  The grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends will all be invited.  There will be about 15 children under the age of 10 to join in the festivities.  We will have finger foods (like chicken nuggets and hot dogs) and mac and cheese for the children.  We will supply many toys (such as Lego Duplo blocks, dolls, stuffed animals, cars, and trains, as well as outdoor toys like tee ball and Frisbees) to enjoy a fun day with the children.\n\nWe look forward to planning birthday parties for our little one.  We would like to have a princess theme, or a tea party, or dinosaurs, or Disney, or Candy Land.  There will be a kids’ party and a family party.
