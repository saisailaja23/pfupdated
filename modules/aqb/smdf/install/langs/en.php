	<h4>A step by step manual on how to create dependent field:</h4>
	Assume that you want to create a State field which should depend on Country field.
	<ul>
		<li>You need to create dependent values list first. To do that click on a `<strong>New dependent list</strong>` link give it a name (let\'s say <strong>State</strong> and select a list on which new list will be dependent (in our case it should be <strong>Country</strong>). After that a new popup window will open allowing you to add/edit values of a new list.</li>
		<li>After dependent list is ready proceed to <strong>[admin panel -> builders -> profile fields]</strong> and add new field and click on it to bring up field properties form (or edit existing field).</li>
		<li>Set common properties of the field like name, caption, description, etc. `<strong>Type</strong>` should be `<strong>Selector</strong>`, `<strong>Selector Control</strong>` should be `<strong>Select (Dropdown Box)</strong>`.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Dependencies</strong> tab. Read notes by moving mouse cursor over the blue exclamation marks. Select the field on which new field depends (in our example it should be <strong>Country</strong>). After that select the list of possible values (the one which we have created in first step of this manual). Decide where you need <strong>AJAX</strong> or not. Then decide whether the field should be self manageable or not (self manageable fields allow users to add their own values). Press Save.</li>
		<li>Done. Not <strong>State</strong> field depends on <strong>Country</strong> field which means that on all pages where <strong>Country/State</strong> pair appears values of <strong>State</strong> field would be loading according to <strong>Country</strong> selected.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Things you shouldn\'t do:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Do not edit list of dependent values at <strong>[admin panel -> settings -> predefined values]</strong>. Edit all dependent lists only at <strong>[admin panel -> modules -> dependent fields]</strong></li>
		<li>Do not leave dependent field on forms without parent field. For example if you have <strong>Country->State</strong> dependency then both of them should always be on all forms (join, edit, search forms).</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Control type on search page:</h4>
	<p>By default all fields of `Select (Dropdown box)` control type appear on search form as multiselectable dropdowns. If you will ever want to remove that ability of multiselection for all dependent fields you can easily do that by editing the file <b>modules/aqb/df/classes/AqbDFConfig.php</b>: at the very top comment out the first line of code and uncomment the second line.</p>
