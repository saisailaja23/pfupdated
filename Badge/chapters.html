                    <p>Jason and I met on an online dating site (yes, it does work!) in 2009. We were married in a 
                    beautiful church in 2012. The vows we took that day in front of God is what keeps our marriage strong.</p>
                    <p>We always knew adoption would be a part of our lives by seeing the love it has brought to our family, 
                    and knowing this is the path that God has chosen for us. We are so excited to become parents and to hear 
                    the pitter patter of little feet!</p>
                    <p>We enjoy many activities together. We especially love game and movie night with our family and friends. 
                    The most popular game chosen by one of the kids is Candy Land...</p>

                           <p>Hi, we are Jason and Amy. The choice you are making today is creating a miracle in our world, and we thank you for getting to know us better. While we are excited to get to know you, there are some things that we already know in our hearts. We know the journey you find yourself on is not the one you originally planned, but we also know that it takes a strong and courageous person to make this decision. We know that you have dreams for this child, and you are prepared to find a way to make them come true. We hope you see those dreams in our family because we would love to be a part of your journey, now and in the future.</p>

                           <h4>LETTER ABOUT JASON</h4>
                           <p>What makes Jason such an amazing guy? Well, he gives the best foot rubs and cooks a fantastic chicken tetrazzini! More than that, he supports me in every endeavor such as traveling near and far to run half-marathons with me. His love never ceases to amaze me. For example, while he was raised Christian, he had never been affiliated with a particular church. It was so important to him that his children be raised in a home where their parents practiced the same religion that he became Catholic during our engagement. But, just when I didn’t think I could love him more, he became a father and I saw a whole new side of him. That goofy uncle who let children climb all over him like a jungle gym became an engaged father helping our child explore the world while perched on his shoulders. The man that was strong and steadfast when dealing with adults is now reduced to mush by our daughter’s smile or laugh. His silly side is still there—like throwing impromptu dance parties in the living room or playing dress up! Life sure is a lot more fun with him around.</p>

                           <h4>LETTER ABOUT AMY</h4>
                           <p>They say that the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach, and that must be true because I don’t think I could live without Amy’s chocolate chip cookies. Nothing beats the sweet smell of her baking them on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Not that there are many lazy days around here. Whether we are bundled in our snow suits cross-country skiing or running a half-marathon, she always finds something fun for us to do as a family. Amy is the anchor of our family and keeps everything running, which is especially important during the long hours of harvest season. That includes making my favorite meal, goulash, and even bringing it out to me when I am working. I not only appreciate the way she takes care of us physically, but also emotionally. Last year for my birthday she threw me a lumberjack themed party and invited family and friends to celebrate—and wear flannel. It was the manliest birthday of all time! She has a way of celebrating what is special about others and making them feel loved. I know she is already excited about planning birthday parties for our children throughout the years.</p>

                           <h4>LETTER ABOUT THEM</h4>
                           <p>We met at a party in 2004. We were set up, but didn’t know it until after we had our “love at first sight” moment. When Jason walked into the room, six foot plus with a black cowboy hat, Amy’s heart skipped a beat. Jason swears it was Amy’s blue eyes that sealed the deal, but who knows. It was a long distance romance at the beginning. Shortly after we met, Jason went into basic training and our only means of communication was through letters. It was in those letters that we truly got to know each other and built a strong bond. We were from different worlds. Jason grew up in the suburbs of Chicago and played college baseball, while Amy grew up on a farm in Michigan and loved to travel. What we did have in common, though, was a large extended family that meant the world to us. And, when we finally tied the knot on an unseasonably hot September afternoon, they were all there to support and celebrate with us! The following spring we moved to Amy’s hometown where Jason began farming and Amy started practicing law. Life was pretty quiet for a while, but a few years into our marriage we were confronted with the reality of infertility. It was a painful and confusing truth because we had so much love to share with a child. After some long talks, a few tears, and a lot of prayers we knew that adoption had been written on our hearts and we began a new and exciting journey.</p>
