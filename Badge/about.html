                    <p>Jason and I met on an online dating site (yes, it does work!) in 2009. We were married in a 
                    beautiful church in 2012. The vows we took that day in front of God is what keeps our marriage strong.</p>
                    <p>We always knew adoption would be a part of our lives by seeing the love it has brought to our family, 
                    and knowing this is the path that God has chosen for us. We are so excited to become parents and to hear 
                    the pitter patter of little feet!</p>
                    <p>We enjoy many activities together. We especially love game and movie night with our family and friends. 
                    The most popular game chosen by one of the kids is Candy Land...</p>

                   <h4 class="male">Jason</h4>
                   <p>What makes Jason such an amazing guy? Well, he gives the best foot rubs and cooks a fantastic chicken tetrazzini! More than that, he supports me in every endeavor such as traveling near and far to run half-marathons with me. His love never ceases to amaze me. For example, while he was raised Christian, he had never been affiliated with a particular church. It was so important to him that his children be raised in a home where their parents practiced the same religion that he became Catholic during our engagement. But, just when I didn’t think I could love him more, he became a father and I saw a whole new side of him. That goofy uncle who let children climb all over him like a jungle gym became an engaged father helping our child explore the world while perched on his shoulders. The man that was strong and steadfast when dealing with adults is now reduced to mush by our daughter’s smile or laugh. His silly side is still there—like throwing impromptu dance parties in the living room or playing dress up! Life sure is a lot more fun with him around.</p>
                   <h4 class="female">Jason</h4>
                   <p>They say that the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach, and that must be true because I don’t think I could live without Amy’s chocolate chip cookies. Nothing beats the sweet smell of her baking them on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Not that there are many lazy days around here. Whether we are bundled in our snow suits cross-country skiing or running a half-marathon, she always finds something fun for us to do as a family. Amy is the anchor of our family and keeps everything running, which is especially important during the long hours of harvest season. That includes making my favorite meal, goulash, and even bringing it out to me when I am working. I not only appreciate the way she takes care of us physically, but also emotionally. Last year for my birthday she threw me a lumberjack themed party and invited family and friends to celebrate—and wear flannel. It was the manliest birthday of all time! She has a way of celebrating what is special about others and making them feel loved. I know she is already excited about planning birthday parties for our children throughout the years.</p>
